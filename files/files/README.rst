Folder files/files/

This files folder is intended for sotring .pdf files that someone may want to download.

The extra file/ folder is design in "main" to create the folder "files".

Web pages are in sub-directories, so the syntax to reference a .pdf in files/files may be..

     ../../files/test.pdf

E.g.

Click to download a pdf file...

.. codeblock::

     .. raw:: html

         <p>
         <a href="../../files/test.pdf" download>
         <button type="button">Click to download test.pdf file</button>
         </a>
         </p>
