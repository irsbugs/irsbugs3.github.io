custom.css
----------

This folder is for the *custom.css* file. When Nikola generates a website it is moved to *main* branch
and placed in the folder /assets/css/ where is then appended to the file *all.css*

It is the final file to be executed in the cascade of css files

Each webpage implements, in the following order, these css files:

* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css 
* https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.11.1/baguetteBox.min.css
* ../../assets/css/all.css

Edit custom.css to change aspects of you webpage theme.
