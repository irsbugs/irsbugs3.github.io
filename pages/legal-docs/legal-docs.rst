Assorted legal or political writings
====================================

Apart from a career spent mostly doing mathematics and computer science
(see `here <../about>`__) I have an interest in legal and justice
issues. And I have some legal qualifications but minimal experience as a
lawyer. My email address is firstname-surname at gmx.com. Comments
welcome.

The UK postmasters
------------------

I got interested in this affair initially because the story was of
allegedly unreliable computer software. In short, the UK post office
introduced a new computer system, "Horizon", which said that numerous
postmasters had lost or stolen money, and there were many prosecutions
and many more demands for repayment.

An English journalist Nick Wallis has done a great deal to bring this
affair to public notice. He has run two websites (one newer, one older),
https://www.postofficescandal.uk/ and https://www.postofficetrial.com/ .

He also has written a book `"The Great Post Office
Scandal" <https://bathpublishing.com/products/the-great-post-office-scandal-first>`__,
which I found hard to put down - it's a terrific mixture of the human
interest stories of the postmasters affected with a detailed account of
the legal processes.

After far too long, it was accepted that the issue was far more likely
to be the unreliability of the computer system than the fault of the
postmasters. There was a huge civil court case, *Bates v Post Office*,
in the UK, followed by criminal appeals to reverse previous convictions.

Having got interested in it because of my background in both law and
proving computer software works correctly, I was quite gobsmacked to
find my experience of doing practical statistics was also relevant to
the issue, in assessing the statistical evidence of the Post Office's
expert witness. Fortunately the judge didn't think much of his analyses
either. I write about that (with a few comments on other points)
`here <worden-writeup>`_

UPDATE: When I wrote that piece I wasn't aware of `Stephen
Mason <https://ials.sas.ac.uk/about/about-us/people/stephen-mason>`__'s
article `The use of statistics and software
code <https://ials.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2019/06/26/the-use-of-statistics-and-software-code/>`__
in which he discusses this in detail - his article quotes and discusses
Dr Worden's statistics as presented in the opening address of the
counsel for the Post Office.

Something Stephen wrote which I found particularly interesting was

   As part of my LLM ... , I took the 'Proof' component with Professor
   Twining. Professor Twining did not let anybody join his course until
   they passed an exam in statistics.

Reliance by the courts on computer evidence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stephen, and Paul Marshall and others, have also written several
articles on the assumption by the courts that computer software is
reliable, for example `The use of the word 'robust' to describe software
code <https://ials.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2019/06/25/the-use-of-the-word-robust-to-describe-software-code/>`__.
For more specifically on the legal background to this, see `Robustness
and reliability in computer
systems <https://ials.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2019/06/28/robustness-and-reliability-in-computer-systems/>`__

Several academic articles on this topic are collected in `special issue
Volume 17 (2020) of Digital Evidence and Electronic Signature Law
Review <https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/issue/view/578>`__

Perverting the course of justice?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of the prosecutions wouldn't have occurred, or succeeded, without
some pretty questionable conduct on the part of the prosecutors. I
collect a lot of details and quotes from relevant case law
`here. <pcj-writeup>`_ This includes an Australian case I found,
about perverting the course of justice by inducing a guilty plea, was
said to be, at the time, the only such case in any Commonwealth court.

Craig Murray - imprisonment for "jigsaw identification"
-------------------------------------------------------

Craig Murray was convicted of contempt for breaching a court order
forbidding the publication of information tending to identify
complainers of sexual assault. One issue was "jigsaw identification",
that is, if lots of people each publish some scrap of information, then
it may be possible to put these together to identify a complainer.

Someone wrote to me

   I have no interest in ever publishing the names of the complainers
   against Alex Salmond myself. The likelihood of someone being able to
   identify someone however is beyond the control of me as nobody can
   know what other information someone already has in regards to this.
   This is why jigsaw identification is such a nonsense.

Quite so.

Another issue is some of the things said in the judgment. These are
written up by `Kirsten MacDonald in Consortium
News <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2021/06/the-mind-of-lady-dorrian/>`__.
My reaction was that they are so extraordinary that the judges must have
been affected by an extreme dislike of Craig and his political activism.
Kirsten MacDonald said

   an experienced journalist told me that they had never seen a judge so
   "emotionally invested", as Dorrian against Craig Murray

I can well believe that.

But in reading the judgments I found a lot else to write about as well,
like the *Moorov* doctrine and "similar fact" evidence, and the nature
of the intent required (or not) for a conviction.

Craig's contempt conviction was for his accounts of the trial of Alex
Salmond for a whole lot of sexual offences. Of course one of the issues
in writing about a Scottish court case is the differences between
English and Scots law. One very notable difference is the *Moorov*
doctrine, about the requirement for corroboration in criminal trials,
and the use of "similar fact" evidence.

Another striking feature was the judge's prejudice against a "journalist
in new media". I found a mass of stuff in support of such people and
their role.

So here is a `piece about these issues <cm-contempt>`_.

So here is a `piece single underscore issues <cm-contempt>`_.
