Social media censorship
=======================

Here we list cases where social media platforms "de-platform" particular
contributors on account of the political views expressed, and delete
their articles, or restrict visibility of some articles/videos. Also
where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular
content creators, for similar reasons.

Scott Ritter
------------

In `this
article <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test>`__
referring to his two-part documentary, "Agent Zelensky" he says

   YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
   eventually banned me from the platform altogether.

This documentary is described
`here, <https://silentpartner.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-parts-1-and-2>`__
`here, <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-part-1>`__ and

and is available on Rumble

Chris Hedges

`He writes <https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/on-being-disappeared>`__

   The entire archive of On Contact, the Emmy-nominated show I hosted
   for six years for RT America and RT International, has been
   disappeared from YouTube...

   I was on RT because, as a critic of US imperialism, militarism, the
   corporate control of the two ruling parties, and especially because I
   support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against
   Israel, I was blacklisted. I was on RT for the same reason the
   dissident Vaclav Havel, who I knew, was on Voice of America during
   the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. It was that or not be heard.
   Havel had no more love for the policies of Washington than I have for
   those of Moscow.

   What were my sins? I did not, like my former employer, The New York
   Times, sell you the lie of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,
   peddle conspiracy theories about Donald Trump being a Russian asset,
   put out a ten-part podcast called the Caliphate that was a hoax, or
   tell you that the contents on Hunter Biden’s laptop was
   “disinformation.”

In fact an `archive of the On Contact
shows <https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/>`__ seems to be available on
rt.com, but only up to February 2022 (shortly before the article linked
above appeared). Then there is also a `Youtube
channel <https://www.youtube.com/@chrishedges7414/videos>`__ currently
available which apparently contains episodes from 7 and 8 years ago.

Meanwhile, he has lots of up-to-date videos and articles on his
`substack <https://chrishedges.substack.com>`__ (and do read his article
`Why subscribe? <https://chrishedges.substack.com/about>`__).
