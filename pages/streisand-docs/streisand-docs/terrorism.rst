Introduction
------------

Before going into detail about the legislation, let me refer you to
Craig Murray's article `Who Are the
Terrorists? <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2024/10/who-are-the-terrorists/>`__
pointing out that the UK government regarded Nelson Mandela as a
terrorist, and the African National Congress as a terrorist
organisation, but, nonetheless, thousands of people wrote in support of
them. He goes on to say

   Under today’s legislation, every single one of those people writing
   in support of the African National Congress or out campaigning for
   the release of Nelson Mandela would have been liable for arrest under
   Section 12(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act.

In the same vein, Jonathan Cook has written, in `Starmer's purges of
Labour have mutated into the arrest of Palestine
supporters <https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2024-08-30/starmer-jailing-palestine-supporters/>`__

   The need for careful distinctions should be obvious. Would praising
   Hamas leaders, even its military leaders, for agreeing to sit down in
   peace talks amount to “support” for a terror organisation? Should it
   lead to arrest and jail time?

   It was never a crime to “support” Sinn Fein – the political wing of
   the IRA – in the sense of having complimentary things to say about
   its long-time leader, Gerry Adams, or backing its political
   positions.

   It wasn’t even illegal to “support” actual IRA “terrorists”. Back in
   the early 1980s, many people criticised the Ulster authorities and
   the British government of Margaret Thatcher for their barbaric
   treatment of IRA prisoners.

UPDATE (Jan 2025): In another more recent article Craig discusses `the
hypocrisy of the UK
government <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/01/will-section-12-die-of-shame/>`__
in relation to its support of HTS (the new Syrian government):

   Until the government, through an Order in Council, actually removes
   the proscription of HTS as a terrorist organisation, it is still
   illegal to support it in the UK – and it is illegal for government
   ministers to support it, let alone ex-functionaries like John Sawers,
   Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart.

   Now in practice, there is nothing to prevent the massive hypocrisy of
   the Terrorism Police harassing, and the CPS prosecuting, people for
   very tangential “support” of Hamas and Hezbollah, while much more
   blatant and open support of HTS goes unpunished.

UPDATE (Feb 2025): In another more recent article Craig tells us `United
Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and
Activists <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/>`__:
as he says, "the second part [of the `letter from the
UN <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL-GBR-15-2024-Craig-Murray-et-al-UN-comm-to-UK-with-cover.pdf>`__]
is a devastating critique of the UK’s terrorism laws".

Now let me bore you with the detail.

The UK Terrorism Acts
---------------------

Firstly, note that there are two of them,
`2000 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents>`__ and
`2006 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/contents>`__.
`Section 1 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/1>`__ gives
the definition of terrorism which is used in both Acts (see `s20(1) of
the 2006
Act) <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/20>`__

**Terrorism: interpretation.**

   (1) In this Act, "terrorism" means the use or threat of action where:

      (a) the action falls within subsection (2);

      (b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or
      an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the
      public or a section of the public; and

      (c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a
      political, religious, racial or ideological cause.

   (2) Action falls within this subsection if it:

      (a) involves serious violence against a person;

      (b) involves serious damage to property;

      (c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person
      committing the action;

      (d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public
      or a section of the public; or

      (e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to
      disrupt an electronic system.

   (3) The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which
   involves the use of firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or
   not subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.

   (4) In this section:

      (a) "action" includes action outside the United Kingdom; and

      (b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any
      person, or to property, wherever situated,

      (c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public
      of a country other than the United Kingdom, and

      (d) "the government" means the government of the United Kingdom,
      of a Part of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the
      United Kingdom.

   (5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of
   terrorism includes a reference to action taken for the benefit of a
   proscribed organisation.

And that's it. Nothing about who is doing it, whether the military of
the UK or another country or the military forces of a de-facto
government or anyone else. Nothing about whether things are being done
in a "just cause", however you might assess that.

In short, it covers equally what might be more usually described as
"war-fighting" than as "terrorism", and whether or not the war-fighting
is legal or "just" or involves war crimes or not.

Less surprisingly, nothing about whether the activities in question are
or were commanded by God (as, eg, in `Deuteronomy
7:1-6 <https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm>`__ or `Deuteronomy
13:6-15 <https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13.htm#6>`__).

Offences
--------

So what are the offences related to terrorism?

`Section 1 of the 2006
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/1>`__:
**Encouragement of terrorism**

   (1) This section applies to a statement that is likely to be
   understood by a reasonable person as a direct or indirect
   encouragement or other inducement to some or all of the members of
   the public to whom it is published, to the commission, preparation or
   instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences.

   (2) A person commits an offence if-

      (a) he publishes a statement to which this section applies or
      causes another to publish such a statement; and

      (b) at the time he publishes it or causes it to be published, he-

         (i) intends members of the public to be directly or indirectly
         encouraged or otherwise induced by the statement to commit,
         prepare or instigate acts of terrorism or Convention offences;
         or

         (ii) is reckless as to whether members of the public will be
         directly or indirectly encouraged or otherwise induced by the
         statement to commit, prepare or instigate such acts or
         offences.

   (3) For the purposes of this section, the statements that are likely
   to be understood by a reasonable person as indirectly encouraging the
   commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences
   include every statement which-

      (a) glorifies the commission or preparation (whether in the past,
      in the future or generally) of such acts or offences; and

      (b) is a statement from which members of the public could
      reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is
      being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them in
      existing circumstances.

   (4) For the purposes of this section the questions how a statement is
   likely to be understood and what members of the public could
   reasonably be expected to infer from it must be determined having
   regard both-

      (a) to the contents of the statement as a whole; and

      (b) to the circumstances and manner of its publication.

   (5) It is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (1) to (3)-

      (a) whether anything mentioned in those subsections relates to the
      commission, preparation or instigation of one or more particular
      acts of terrorism or Convention offences, of acts of terrorism or
      Convention offences of a particular description or of acts of
      terrorism or Convention offences generally; and,

      (b) whether any person is in fact encouraged or induced by the
      statement to commit, prepare or instigate any such act or offence.

So these provisions apparently apply, for example, to the following
examples:

- Arguing that particular violent action (meeting the defintion of
  "terrorism") is justified
- Arguing that it is not justified, and accordingly violent resistance
  to it is justified

Proscribed organisations
------------------------

Per `Section
3 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/3>`__ and
following, the Secretary of State may proscribe an organisation if he
believes that it is concerned in terrorism, which, as described above,
is a very low bar. There is apparently no obligation upon him to
proscribe such an organisation, so he can limit proscribed organisations
to ones he doesn't like.

But once an organisation is proscribed, then it is an offence to
"support" it.

`Section 12 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/12>`__:
**Support**

   (1) A person commits an offence if-

      (a) he invites support for a proscribed organisation, and

      (b) the support is not, or is not restricted to, the provision of
      money or other property (within the meaning of section 15).

   (1A) A person commits an offence if the person-

      (a) expresses an opinion or belief that is supportive of a
      proscribed organisation, and

      (b) in doing so is reckless as to whether a person to whom the
      expression is directed will be encouraged to support a proscribed
      organisation.

   (2) A person commits an offence if he arranges, manages or assists in
   arranging or managing a meeting which he knows is-

      (a) to support a proscribed organisation,

      (b) to further the activities of a proscribed organisation, or

      (c) to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong
      to a proscribed organisation.

   (3) A person commits an offence if he addresses a meeting and the
   purpose of his address is to encourage support for a proscribed
   organisation or to further its activities.

The word "support" is, conveniently, not defined. Does it mean something
like "assist in the affairs of", or merely something like "express
approval of", or even just "approve of"?

In the case `Choudary & Anor v R. [2016] EWCA Crim
61 <https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2016/61.html>`__ the Court
said at para 35

   [the section] does not prohibit the holding of opinions or beliefs
   supportive of a proscribed organisation; or the expression of those
   opinions or beliefs

But that was before s12(1A) was inserted (apparently as a result of this
case). And "support", as in s12(1A)(b) now, is still not clearly
defined.

So, where a proscribed organisation is a government (or some sort of
pseudo-government), is it an offence to

- express approval of any government (or the like) operating schools,
  hospitals and so forth?
- express approval of a particular government (or the like) operating
  schools, hospitals and so forth?
- express an opinion as to the legality (or otherwise) of any action it
  undertakes, or its adversaries undertake?
- express an opinion as to whether in fact it meets the requirements to
  be proscribed?

Who knows? Which I guess is exactly the point. The authorities can
justify prosecuting anyone whose views they don't like. And of course,
even in the event of acquittal, for a defendant, undergoing the process
itself is substantial punishment.

Schedule 7
----------

By `Schedule 7 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7>`__,
sub-paragraph 2(1), a person arriving in the UK may be questioned

   ... for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person
   falling within section
   `40(1)(b) <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40>`__

that is, a person who

   is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or
   instigation of acts of terrorism

(as defined in Section 1).

Since it says "*being concerned in* the commission [etc] of acts of
terrorism" rather than, for example, *encouraging* or *inducing* the
commission [etc] of such acts (as in Section 1 of the 2006 Act), one
might think it means some actual involvement. If so it is hard to
imagine what grounds the authorities might have had for applying
Schedule 7 to `Ernest
Moret <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/chilling-arrest-of-french-publisher-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police-condemned-ernest-moret>`__
or `Craig
Murray <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2023/10/incredibly-i-face-investigation-for-terrorism-defence-funds-appeal/>`__.
But then, it is stated specifically, in sub-paragraph 2(4), that

   An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph
   whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person falls
   within section 40(1)(b)

So there it is, this encourages them to do this to anyone they choose.
In fact, according to David Miller, `people of Pakistani ethnicity are
over 150 times more likely to be detained under Schedule 7 than white
people <https://trackingpower.substack.com/p/what-is-islamophobia>`__.

On the other hand the questioning must be *for the purpose of
determining whether he appears to be a person who ...* I'd certainly
like to see the results of a case where the police were required to show
that that was in fact their purpose.

Training
--------

Then of course there is training. `Section 6 of the 2006
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/6>`__ covers
training "in connection with ... acts of terrorism" (though there need
not be *specific* acts in view), and we have discussed how broadly
"terrorism" is defined.

Somewhat overlapping this is `Section 54 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/54>`__

**54 Weapons training.**

   (1) A person commits an offence if he provides instruction or
   training in the making or use of-

      (a) firearms

   (2) A person commits an offence if he receives instruction or
   training in the making or use of-

      (a) firearms

This seems to cover, fair and square, my own involvement in the school
cadets at my secondary school. In my defence, I was never a particularly
enthusiastic cadet - most of the kids in my class were promoted to
corporal for our second year, but not I. Though admittedly, this was
more because of my lack of interest in polishing boots and belt buckles,
rather than because of a distaste for racing around the bush firing
rifles (loaded with blanks) at pretend Vietnamese peasants.

There is a defence - if the person charged can prove that his
involvement was nothing to do with terrorism (as defined, broadly,
discussed above - difficult to prove, I imagine, when the training is
intended to introduce one to the possibility of a career which would
include firing rifles at Vietnamese peasants).

And both these sections about training offences apply to training
outside the UK (`Section 17 of the 2006
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/17>`__) and
the terrorism envisaged in the training may also be outside the UK
(s1(4) of the 2000 Act, quoted above). Thus the fact that my own
"terrorist training" took place in Australia is beside the point. This,
then, makes me a "terrorist" (`Section 40 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40>`__) and so
subject to arrest without a warrant (`Section 41(1) of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/41>`__).

Further lunatic provisions
--------------------------

`Section 58 of the 2000
Act <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/58>`__ makes
it an offence to record, possess or view over the internet "information
of a kind likely to be useful to [a terrorist]" (s58(1)). Which
obviously includes road maps, train or bus timetables, and so forth.

In the case of this provision the House of Lords has said, in `R v G, R
v J [2009] UKHL
13 <https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/13.html>`__

   42. Parliament cannot have intended to criminalise the possession of
   information of a kind which is useful to people for all sorts of
   everyday purposes and which many members of the public regularly
   obtain or use, simply because that information could also be useful
   to someone who was preparing an act of terrorism.

It's nice that in this case the court has decided that what the Act says
is too stupid to be taken seriously. But one can never rely on the
courts taking this approach.

There is a defence of "reasonable excuse" (s58(3)), of which examples
are given (s58(3A)). Bizarrely, one of the examples of reasonable excuse
is one of the possible scenarios where there is an absence of *mens
rea*, see paras 47, 50 and 60 of R v G, R v J. But a notable omission
from the examples of reasonable excuse is the very likely candidate,
having a reason for the possession (etc) that is nothing to do with
terrorism. In fact the House of Lords, in R v G, R v J, overruling an
earlier case, decided that this would not necessarily be a reasonable
excuse (paras 71 to 73 and following).

The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act
---------------------------------------------

There seems to be quite a smorgasbord of legislation which the
authorities can use against people they don't like. In the case of `Kit
Klarenberg <https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/>`__
it was the `Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act
2019 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/contents>`__ Mostly,
it seems, this Act amends the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006, but its
`Schedule 3 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3>`__
seems to provide new powers. Schedule 3 seems to be mostly very similar
to Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 but for a different purpose.

By `Schedule
3 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3>`__,
sub-paragraph 1(1), a person arriving in the UK may be questioned

   ... for the purpose of determining whether the person appears to be a
   person who is, or has been, engaged in hostile activity ...

The definition of "hostile activity" seems arguably sensible, but as
with Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, we have in, sub-paragraph
1(4)

   An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph
   whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person is or has
   been engaged in hostile activity.

But, again, the questioning must be for this purpose.

R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64
----------------------

Thanks to `Aya / Challenge the
Narrative <https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression>`__
for mentioning this case. The case `R v Gul [2013] UKSC
64 <https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/64.html>`__, in the
Supreme Court, was primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in section
1 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

It says a lot about the breadth of the definition of terrorism, notably
in paragraphs 28,29,33,34,61. In particular: (the following expressed
rather tentatively in para 28)

   ... the definition of terrorism in section 1 in the 2000 Act is, at
   least if read in its natural sense, very far reaching indeed. Thus,
   on occasions, activities which might command a measure of public
   understanding, if not support, may fall within it: for example,
   activities by the victims of oppression abroad, which might command a
   measure of public understanding, and even support in this country,
   may well fall within it.

The following are about or quoted from an Independent Reviewer of the
legislation.

   actions may amount to terrorism within the definition "even when they
   might otherwise constitute lawful hostilities under international
   humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive
   governments)" (para 33)

and the definition was referred to as

   "remarkably broad – absurdly so in some cases" (para 34)

..

   "the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist
   group to be turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation
   in a lawful armed conflict, however great the provocation and however
   odious the regime which they have attacked" (para 61)

The judgment makes the point that the consent of the DPP is required for
a prosecution, this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should
not be instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public
interest" (para 36). However, importantly, the Court pointed out

   The Crown's reliance on prosecutorial discretion is intrinsically
   unattractive, as it amounts to saying that the legislature, whose
   primary duty is to make the law, and to do so in public, has in
   effect delegated to an appointee of the executive, albeit a respected
   and independent lawyer, the decision whether an activity should be
   treated as criminal for the purposes of prosecution. ... [This] risks
   undermining the rule of law. It involves Parliament abdicating a
   significant part of its legislative function to an unelected DPP, or
   to the Attorney General, who, though he is accountable to Parliament,
   does not make open, democratically accountable decisions in the same
   way as Parliament. Further, such a device leaves citizens unclear as
   to whether or not their actions or projected actions are liable to be
   treated by the prosecution authorities as effectively innocent or
   criminal ...

Furthermore the protection afforded by the DPP's "prosecutorial
discretion" applies only to the bringing of charges to court. Regarding
"police officers deciding whom to arrest or to stop at a port" (para
34), or the Home Secretary deciding which organisations to proscribe, it
provides no such protection. The judgment discusses this in paras
33,34,37,63,64. Thus the Independent Reviewer referred to

   the risk that "strong powers could be used for purposes other than
   the suppression of terrorism as it is generally understood" (para 33)

and that even where the activity does not warrant prosecution

   First, the lawfulness of executive acts such as detention, search,
   interrogation and arrest could be questioned only very rarely indeed
   in relation to any actual or suspected involvement in actual or
   projected acts involving "terrorism", in circumstances where there
   would be no conceivable prospect of such involvement being
   prosecuted. Secondly, the fact that an actual or projected activity
   technically involves "terrorism" means that, as a matter of law, that
   activity will be criminal under the provisions of the 2000 and 2006
   Acts, long before, and indeed quite irrespective of whether, any
   question of prosecution arises. (para 37)

The judgment in the appeal (para 5) recounts how, in the trial the jury
asked

   "Re: definition of terrorism in [section 1 of the 2000 Act], would
   the use of force by Coalition forces be classed as terrorism?"

In relation to that question, the judge gave the following direction:

   "... the use of force by Coalition forces is not terrorism. They do
   enjoy combat immunity, they are ordered there by our government and
   the American government, unless they commit crimes such as torture or
   war crimes ...".

I have to say that I am not at all surprised that there should be some
such legal principle giving such forces "combat immunity". But I would
be very surprised indeed if there were legislation somewhere (of which
I've not seen any hint) which amends the definition of "terrorism" in
the 2000 Act to exclude action by "Coalition forces". In fact, the
Independent Reviewer mentioned the "potential application of the
Terrorism Acts even to UK forces engaged in conflicts overseas" (para
61).

R v F [2007] EWCA Crim 243
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The case `R v F [2007] EWCA Crim
243 <https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/243.html>`__, in the
Court of Appeal, also primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in
section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000, makes some similar points at paras
11,27,32.

   11. ... "counter-terrorism measures were capable of application to
   speech or actions concerning resistance to an oppressive regime
   overseas ..."

..

   27. ... Finally, the legislation does not ... exculpate what some
   would describe as terrorism in a just cause.

   32. ... the terrorist legislation applies to countries which are
   governed by tyrants and dictators. There is no exemption from
   criminal liability for terrorist activities which are motivated or
   said to be morally justified by the alleged nobility of the terrorist
   cause.

Another problem with prosecutorial discretion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, the consent of the DPP is required for a
prosecution, this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should not
be instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public interest",
and I've noted above what the Court said about that in R v Gul.

There is an additional problem with this line of thinking. It accepts
that there are some circumstances where there should not be a
prosecution, even when a literal application of the Acts to the facts of
a case makes a defendant guilty. But the jury, not the DPP, decides what
facts have been proved against a defendant, and no one other than the
jury will ever know what facts have been proved. So, if the surrounding
circumstances, for example

- that the terrorism constitutes lawful hostilities under international
  humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive
  governments)
- that the terrorism is participation in a lawful armed conflict, after
  great provocation and against an odious regime

(these examples taken from R v Gul, see above) justify saying the
prosecution should not proceed, then (unless all the facts are agreed)
only the jury can decide this.

But there have been instances recently of judges refusing to allow
defendants to give evidence or argue about aspects of a case which don't
strictly affect guilt or not under the legislation as written - so then
the jury wouldn't be in a position to take these other aspects into
account.

I will discuss this more in a page on Trudi Warner.

The `National Security Act
2023 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/32/contents>`__ equally
