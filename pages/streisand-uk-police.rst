Other UK Police (etc) actions
=============================

So many of these! When you read about them you might think that Britain
must be a wonderfully crime-free society, that the police have time to
spend on trivia like these cases. But no. Persecuting opinions they
don't like is clearly more important than, for example, bike theft.
Regarding which, `this
article <https://www.londoncentric.media/p/how-to-catch-a-london-bike-thief>`__
says

   Dunn said he had sympathy with the Met Police's response given their
   financial constraints: "You would honestly struggle to put bike theft
   quite high up the list when you look at what else happens in society
   - rapes, murders, assaults. It obviously and probably should be put
   lower down that pecking order."

Apparently this should now read "when you look at what else happens in
society - rapes, murders, assaults, `placards depicting politicians as
coconuts <https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression>`__,
commentary on Palestine by those opposed to genocide, ..."

A lot of these actions are based on one of the Terrorism Acts, or
similar legislation. I've also written an `article about this
legislation <./terrorism.html>`__, in particular about the absurd
breadth of the definition of "terrorism".

UPDATE (Feb 2025): Some news in an article by Craig Murray: `United
Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and
Activists <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/>`__:
the `letter from the
UN <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL-GBR-15-2024-Craig-Murray-et-al-UN-comm-to-UK-with-cover.pdf>`__
says

   We note that the examination of each journalist [... was] conducted
   despite the apparent absence of a credible “terrorist” connection. We
   are concerned that such powers carry a risk of intimidating,
   deterring, and disrupting the ability of journalists to report on
   topics of public importance without self-censorship.

David Miller has written an article about several of these cases, in `Al
Mayadeen <https://english.almayadeen.net/articles/opinion/the-uk-attempt-to-criminalise-dissent-on-palestine>`__
and in `his own
substack <https://trackingpower.substack.com/p/the-uk-attempt-to-criminalise-dissent>`__.
He says most of those he mentions have been guests on `Palestine
Declassified <https://x.com/PDeclassified>`__. So there's a Streisand
Effect viewing (it has videos) recommendation. There seem to be other
links to it, `here <https://www.presstv.ir/Section/150108>`__,
`here <https://rumble.com/c/c-2038345>`__, and
`here <https://www.instagram.com/palestinedeclassified/>`__.

Haim Bresheeth
--------------

Quoting `Laura / Normal Island
News <https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/israel-secures-victory-over-the-biggest>`__:

   You will be pleased to know British police are taking their role as
   enforcers of the Israeli state so seriously that they’ve arrested a
   Jewish Israeli academic because he explained Israel is fighting an
   unwinnable war. Professor Haim Bresheeth pointed out that British
   police have been arresting people for opposing genocide, leaving
   police with no choice but to arrest him under the Terrorism Act.

   Metropolitan police explained they actually arrested Prof Bresheeth
   for “expressing support for a proscribed terrorist organisation”.
   Awkwardly, a recording of his speech shows he said no such thing

Further discussion by `Ricky / Council Estate
Media <https://www.councilestatemedia.uk/p/britain-is-counting-jewish-israeli>`__:
it is all worth quoting, but in particular

   Either an overzealous police officer overreacted, or more likely,
   this was part of a strategy of silencing opposition to genocide.

   The officer might as well have said: "I’m arresting you for being the
   wrong kind of Jew and having a conscience. We’ll work out the details
   later."

This `Skwawkbox
article <https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-prof-haim-bresheeths-anti-genocide-speech-before-he-was-arrested-for-terrorism/>`__
contains a video of his speech, and says, accurately,

   In fact, as a hearing of his speech immediately reveals, rather than
   supporting any [proscribed organisation] Bresheeth made the factual
   observation that Israel has proven unable to defeat Hamas, Hezbollah
   and the Houthis ...

And Skwawkbox also `links to a video of the
arrest <https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-video-see-jewish-professors-arrest-by-met-police-for-terrorism-of-condemning-israels-genocide/>`__
in which it is alleged that Prof Bresheeth made a "hate speech", and
that this justifies arrest under the `Terrorism Act
2000 <./terrorism.html>`__.

As I've come to expect, this event was hardly covered in the UK
mainstream media. Who did think it was worth covering?

- `Al
  Jazeera <https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/11/4/jewish-academic-arrested-in-uk-over-terrorism-after-gaza-speech>`__
- `World Socialist Web
  Site <https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/11/04/mbte-n04.html>`__
- `Middle East
  Eye <https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-police-arrest-israeli-academic-haim-bresheeth-speech-pro-palestine-demonstration>`__
- `New
  Arab <https://www.newarab.com/news/uk-israeli-academic-arrested-after-speech-gaza-protest>`__
- `Pravda <https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/05/827369.html>`__
- `London
  Daily <https://londondaily.com/uk-authorities-arrest-israeli-academic-for-pro-palestine-speech>`__
- and, more surprisingly, `the Murdoch press here in
  Australia <https://www.news.com.au/world/jewish-academic-arrested-in-uk-over-terrorism-after-gaza-speech/video/f5abf63f2b8a6a2bf401b851a29e06ae>`__

Finally, my recommendations for reading/viewing what they don't want you
to see. Of course there is the video of the speech itself, in the
Skwawkbox page linked above. Then, Prof Bresheeth has a
`website <https://www.haimbresheeth.com/>`__, which seems to be more
about events 10 and 15 years ago.

It's interesting, though, as a glance at `this part of the
site <https://haimbresheeth.com/gaza/gaza-carnage-archive/>`__ leaves me
with the impression that nothing much has changed since then, except
that both sides have cooperated in ensuring that it is less easy to
ignore the conflict.

The various reports associate Prof Bresheeth and/or the meeting at which
he spoke with

- `International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network <https://ijan.org/>`__
- `Jewish Network for
  Palestine <https://jewishnetworkforpalestine.uk/>`__

Natalie Strecker
----------------

She was arrested in Jersey, which seems to have laws similar or
identical to the UK, for inviting support for a proscribed organisation,
details
`here <https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2024/11/16/jep-exclusive-palestine-campaigner-arrested-under-terrorism-law/>`__.
With no details of how she allegedly did this, the Streisand Effect
reading recommendations are a sample of other things she has said or
written, for example

- `Why I referred myself to the Labour Party’s Compliance Unit for
  antisemitism <https://mondoweiss.net/2020/02/why-i-referred-myself-to-the-labour-partys-compliance-unit-for-antisemitism/>`__,
  a novel approach to the Labour party's "clear attempt to shut down
  Palestinian solidarity" (2020)
- `a speech (text and video) at a rally about
  Gaza <https://skwawkbox.org/2023/11/13/ceasefire-now-the-speech-and-video-you-need-to-read-and-watch/>`__
- `3 Months as a Human Rights Monitor in Occupied Palestine: A podcast
  interview with Natalie
  Strecker <https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/3-months-as-a-human-rights-monitor-in-occupied-palestine-a-podcast-interview-with-natalie-strecker-501bf2ebc8cb>`__
  (from 2019)
- `How to support the Jewish community without being anti-Palestinian:
  And my experiences of the weaponization of antisemitism in
  Jersey <https://medium.com/nine-by-five-media/how-to-support-the-jewish-community-without-being-anti-palestinian-8a72c370f1ba>`__
  (2020)

And here is the link to the `Jersey Palestine Solidarity
Campaign <https://www.facebook.com/watch/JerseyPSC/>`__ which I assume
is the organisation which Natalie describes having set up.

Kit Klarenberg
--------------

He was detained and questioned, for over 5 hours, under `Schedule
3 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3>`__ of the
Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, "for the purpose
[allegedly] of determining whether [he] appears to be a person who is,
or has been, engaged in hostile activity". Schedule 3 seems to be mostly
very similar to Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 but to do with
"hostile activity" rather than "terrorism".

This encounter is described in `The
Grayzone <https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/>`__,
and also `The Cradle <https://thecradle.co/articles-id/267>`__ and
`Skwawkbox <https://skwawkbox.org/2023/05/31/uk-police-detain-uk-investigative-journalist-klarenberg-and-grill-him-over-journalism-political-views/>`__

Of the many publications I wrote for, Kit says, "their overwhelming, if
not exclusive, interest was in The Grayzone." This makes the Streisand
Effect reading recommendation easy, doesn't it? Do read `The
Grayzone <https://thegrayzone.com>`__.

UPDATE: I've just seen that Kit has a substack site called `Global
Delinquents <https://www.kitklarenberg.com/>`__

Tommy Robinson
--------------

This website is about encouraging you to read, and providing links to,
writing which have been censored, or the writers punished, etc. So by
rights I should be providing a link to Tommy Robinson's film,
"Silenced", and suggesting you view it. But I'm not doing so. Not
primarily because he is so "right-wing" that he is not welcome in even
Nigel Farage's Reform party.

The story, briefly, is that Robinson, whose real name is Yaxley-Lennon,
had made some very nasty statements about a schoolboy, who sued him for
defamation. See `Hijazi v Yaxley-Lennon [2021] EWHC 2008
(QB) <https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/2008.html>`__. The
judge found (para 163)

   ... the Defendant has failed to demonstrate the truth of his
   allegations. The Defendant took on the burden of proving his
   allegations to be true. He has failed. In reality, and for the
   reasons I have explained, his evidence fell woefully short.

The judge also issued an injunction against Yaxley-Lennon prohibiting
him from repeating the allegations. In October 2024 he was found to have
breached the injunction, for which he was committed to prison for 18
months (which would get reduced by half). See `HM Solicitor General v
Yaxley-Lennon [2024] EWHC 2732
(KB) <https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2024/2732.html>`__: para 6
(terms of the injunction), paras 10 and 16 (detail of breaches). It
appears in particular that in the film "Silenced" Yaxley-Lennon
complains about being silenced (by the injunction) and also repeats the
defamatory allegations.

So, rather than recommend you watch the film, I recommend you read the
first judgment linked above. Or the writeup by `Logically Facts,
here <https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/article/tommy-robinson-silenced>`__.
As a matter of fact, it may be that to recommend you watch the film (as,
reportedly, Elon Musk has done) would itself be a contempt of court, see
`Attorney General v Punch Ltd [2002] UKHL
50 <https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/UKHL_2002_50.html>`__ -
comments from legal experts welcome!

Another comment: the police seem to have got me to agree with Tommy
Robinson about something (quite an achievement), namely misuse of
terrorism legislation. See `an interview he did with Jordan
Peterson <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv0TW2LF_dE>`__, from 11:33.
Apparently he was detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
According to him, the police gave him a notice saying they believed [he
was involved in - sound unclear] the instigation and preparation of acts
of terrorism, but then they told him they didn't actually believe that.
That's odd, since the legislation doesn't require the police to believe
it, but it *does* require them to be questioning him *for the purpose*
of determining whether it is so. What I've read about him is mostly
adverse, but nothing suggestive of a connection with terrorism.

Vanessa Beeley
--------------

She was detained and interrogated for six hours under Schedule 3 of the
Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. This permits questioning

   a person for the purpose of determining whether the person appears to
   be a person who is, or has been, engaged in hostile activity

She says

   I was (I believe) the first in what would be a series of detentions
   of UK citizens - journalists or individuals with views that challenge
   UK foreign policy.

In her `excellent
article <https://beeley.substack.com/p/we-are-all-potential-terrorists-according>`__
she describes and comments on her experience, and also discusses and
quotes from John Laughland who had a similar experience.

She has a Youtube video: `My interview with Slow News Day covering my
recent detention for 6 hours at Heathrow - courtesy of UK Anti Terrorism
Police. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuu5JrGE-NQ>`__

She operates a `substack site <https://beeley.substack.com>`__.

Sarah Wilkinson
---------------

She was arrested under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (support for
a proscribed organisation). The grounds for this are discussed in detail
by `Jonathan
Cook <https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2024-08-30/starmer-jailing-palestine-supporters/>`__
(also
`here <https://jonathancook.substack.com/p/starmers-purges-of-labour-have-mutated>`__).

She is described as a "roving reporter" for *MENA Uncensored*, which is
variously described as a Lebanon-based news site, and as a social media
account. All I can find is a `Youtube
channel <https://www.youtube.com/@MENAUncensored/videos>`__: some of the
videos there are reports by Sarah.

Possibly because

   The police came to her house just before 7.30am. 12 of them in total,
   some of them in plain clothes from the counter terrorism police. They
   said she was under arrest for "content that she has posted online."
   Her house is being raided & they have seized all her electronic
   devices.

this was widely reported, including by `The
Cradle <https://thecradle.co/articles-id/26634>`__,
`CommonDreams <https://www.commondreams.org/news/sarah-wilkinson>`__,
`Middle East
Monitor <https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240830-uk-arrests-peace-activist-sarah-wilkinson/>`__,

Yael Khan
---------

As reported by Skwawkbox (link below),

   The Starmer government, which has refused to condemn Israel’s actions
   and has said it considers the use of the word ‘genocide’ unhelpful,
   is engaged in an escalating campaign of abusing anti-terror
   legislation to raid and arrest journalists and activists – many of
   them, like Ms Kahn and Prof Bresheet, Jewish – who expose Israel’s
   war crimes.

Sometimes in these situations it is hard to find what the person
victimised actually wrote or said, which is frustrating because it is
the purpose of this website to publicise just that. But in this case
`Skwawkbox is publishing the uncompromising speech she gave before her
arrest <https://skwawkbox.org/2025/01/05/exclusive-video-israeli-anti-genocide-activists-speech-before-arrest-at-hotovely-protest/>`__.
Thanks Skwawkbox!

I also found a shorter video on Middle East Eye, `'Not in my name': The
story of a Jewish Israeli
dissident <https://www.middleeasteye.net/video/not-my-name-story-jewish-israeli-dissident>`__.
The write-up there about her says

   Yael Kahn has been campaigning for Palestine for 51 years. A Jewish
   Israeli woman, she's been advocating for a free Palestine since 1972
   and believes it's her obligation to advocate for Palestinians
   everywhere, saying: "I lived on the land stolen from them, so I have
   no excuse."
