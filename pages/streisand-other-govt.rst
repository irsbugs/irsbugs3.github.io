Other Government actions
========================

Here we list cases of government actions such as travel restrictions (eg
cancelling visas), arrest or mistreatment of journalists, etc.

Jeremy Loffredo
---------------

Arrested apparently for a report about

   strikes launched at military targets inside Israel by Iran. He was
   blindfolded, shackled in a military truck and placed in solitary
   confinement for three days with little food or water. He was
   eventually deported.

Here is the `video
report <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu0zptW49eM>`__, here is a
`Grayzone article about
it <https://thegrayzone.com/2024/10/11/israeli-jails-grayzones-jeremy-loffredo/>`__,
and here is `an interview with Chris
Hedges <https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/israels-war-on-the-foreign-press>`__.

Scott Ritter
------------

I mention him after reading his account:

   Unfortunately, the US government had other plans - I was prevented
   from boarding my flight out of JFK on June 3 by three armed Customs
   and Border Protection officers, who seized my passport under
   instructions from the State Department.

as described
`here <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/ask-the-inspectorus-tour-of-duty>`__,
but he also records that he had been "targeted" by the USA government
long before that:

   The FBI investigated me for making a documentary film, "In Shifting
   Sands," which made the case that Iraq had been disarmed by UN weapons
   inspectors. Because this movie embraced a narrative which
   contradicted the case for war being made by the US government, I was
   targeted for character assassination.

That, and a lot else, are described
`here <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/why-matt-gaetz-matters>`__.

The film, full title "In Shifting Sands: The Truth About Unscom and the
Disarming of Iraq" is on `Youtube
here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yjv4J6nxdk>`__. Scott has a
`substack site <https://scottritter.substack.com/>`__. I came across
`this
article <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/in-search-of-empathy>`__ on
it which I thought particularly worth reading.

In a more recent
`article <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test>`__
Scott says

   My house was raided by the FBI using FARA as a pretext; in
   conversations with the senior FBI agents present, the justification
   for this raid stemmed from an article I published on my Substack
   which addressed the issue of Russophobia in America, and which
   incorporated material I had received from the Russian Ambassador to
   the United States at the time, Anatoly Antonov, whom I interviewed
   for this article.

He doesn't identify the article but I'm guessing it is `this
one <https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-red-scare-20-russophobia-in-america>`__.

Ali Abunimah
------------

The `Electronic Intifada <https://electronicintifada.net/>`__'s
executive director `Ali
Abunimah <https://electronicintifada.net/people/ali-abunimah>`__ was
`arrested by Swiss
police <https://electronicintifada.net/content/eis-ali-abunimah-arrested-switzerland/50333>`__
ahead of a speaking event in Zurich on Saturday afternoon. The article
doesn't say what were the (alleged) grounds for this, but no doubt
Caitlin Johnstone sums it up well: `Another Journalist Arrested In
Another Western Nation For Wrongthink About
Israel <https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/another-journalist-arrested-in-another>`__.

I trust you can guess what are the consequent Streisand Effect reading
recommendations: there are links above to the EI, and to Ali Abunimah's
own articles.
