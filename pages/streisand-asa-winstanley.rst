Asa Winstanley
==============

What happened is best described in his own
`words <https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/they-wont-stop-us-that-easily>`__.

The events were also described
`here <https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/uk-police-raid-home-seize-devices-eis-asa-winstanley>`__.

Asa was awakened at 5:40 am by a police raid, said to be "on account of
[his] social media posts", in connection with possible offences under
sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act (2006).

Asa has just published another article about it,
`here <https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/did-british-police-raid-me-for-this>`__

Why the raid was scheduled for 5:40am was not apparent. Nor was why, to
find material he has posted on the internet, looking on the internet
isn't the way to go.

In any event, I encourage you to look at his writings that are so
disliked by the authorities: his substack, `Palestine is Still the
Issue <https://asawinstanley.substack.com/>`__, and the `Electronic
Intifada <https://electronicintifada.net/people/asa-winstanley>`__ give
you plenty.

According to the `World Socialist Web
Site <https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/10/18/vmbx-o18.html>`__

   Winstanley is associate editor at `The Electronic
   Intifada <https://electronicintifada.net>`__, and has also written
   for `Declassified UK <https://www.declassifieduk.org/>`__, `Middle
   East Monitor <https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/>`__, `Middle East
   Eye <https://www.middleeasteye.net/>`__, `The
   National <https://www.thenational.scot/>`__, and
   `Jacobin <https://jacobin.com/>`__, and is the author of `Weaponising
   Anti-Semitism: How the Israel Lobby Brought Down Jeremy
   Corbyn <https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/weaponising-anti-semitism/>`__.

One must of course ask: does any of his writing amount to "encouragement
of terrorism"? Probably. Does that bother me? Not a bit. Why? Because of
the ludicrously broad definition of terrorism under the Terrorism Acts -
under which I myself am a "terrorist" (on account of my service with the
school cadets at my secondary school nearly 60 years ago). A `future
article <./terrorism.html>`__ will elaborate on this.

Of course, if anyone comes across anything he has written which offends
against the Terrorism Acts *and* is actually objectionable, do let me
know. For example, had he supported cutting off water and power from
Gaza. (For this example of conduct offending against the Terrorism Acts
I am indebted to `Sir Keir
Starmer <https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/sir-keir-starmer-hamas-terrorism-israel-defend-itself/>`__.)

An internet search reveals that this event was hardly covered by the
mainstream media, the one exception I found being `the National
(Scotland) <https://www.thenational.scot/news/24663361.counterterrorism-police-raid-home-pro-palestine-journalist-londo/>`__.
So here are my reading recommendations from among sources that did cover
it. (In some cases the articles on the web seem to be pay-walled but by
subscribing I got them sent by email).

  Johnstone <https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/more-authoritarian-crackdowns-on>`__,
  who says

     They understand that whoever controls the narrative controls the
     world.

     So please don't make the mistake of thinking your attempts to
     disrupt their narrative control aren't working. Don't let anyone
     tell you your protests don't make a difference or your dissident
     speech poses no threat to the powerful. If what we're doing wasn't
     working, empire managers wouldn't be going nuts trying to stop us.

- `Craig
  Murray <https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2024/10/who-are-the-terrorists/>`__,
  who says

     Panicked Zionist "elites" who run western states are lashing out in
     fear at their opponents. As their popular support evaporates in the
     face of clear evidence of appalling Israeli atrocities, they are
     resorting to the methods of fascism.

- `Laura / Normal Island
  News <https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/everyone-who-opposes-genocide-is>`__,
  who says

     British counter-terrorism police visited the home of a man under
     suspicion of practising journalism. Disgustingly, the man had been
     raising awareness of Israel's genocide, and therefore had to be
     dealt with.

     ... Asa Winstanley. He is one of the most prominent figures in the
     worrying wave of radicals who believe genocide is wrong, even when
     Israel does it

  Did I mention her work is described as "parody/satire"? Which is why I
  always enjoy reading her articles. Though last time I looked up to see
  what was the truth underlying `one of her
  articles <https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/the-real-victim-of-genocide-is-the>`__,
  I found the facts were just as extraordinary as the "parody/satire".

- `Ricky / Council Estate
  Media <https://www.councilestatemedia.uk/p/the-british-government-is-still-arresting>`__,
  who says

     Personally, I don’t think any of the recent arrests/visits by
     counter-terrorism police are going to result in convictions. I hope
     I’m not tempting fate, but I think this is primarily about
     intimidation, and that is despicable in itself.

     The mistake Asa made is the same mistake I made: he built up a
     platform and challenged powerful people. If you do that, those
     powerful people will come for you. All of us with a sizable
     platform are waiting to be next. It’s genuinely nuts.

- Finally, `Aya / Challenge the
  Narrative <https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression>`__,
  a recommendation not because of writing about Asa Winstanley: but
  because she discussed the Terrorism Acts, which was helpful for my
  `own article <./terrorism.html>`__. She writes very powerfully and
  passionately, eg,
  `here <https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-final-solution-in-gaza-is-happening>`__,
  leaving me wondering if there is something wrong with me, that I don't
  feel it nearly so intensely.
