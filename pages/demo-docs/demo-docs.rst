Demonstration of Nikola Static Website Features
===============================================

These examples are provided during development. If a feature is requested then the code needed may be copied from here. 
  
Feedback
========

As Nikola websites are static, they can not be publically written to. 

However there maybe times when you need a form to capture details from a person. A form is provided, then after collecting 
data it needs to be sent to another website whom provide the service of e-mailing the data to your e-mail address. 
This way your own personal e-mail address is not exposed in the source code of the webpage with the form. 

One vendor that provides this service is *Formspree*. 
Limitations are: Use Formspree for testing and development with unlimited projects and forms, limited to 50 submissions/month.

See: `Formspree <https://formspree.io/plans>`__.

Downloading Files
=================

It is common to allow the downloading of files. Normally they are .pdf files.


.. comment:
    Making pdf files available for downloading:
    -------------------------------------------

    Change: conf.py from: FILES_FOLDERS = {'files': ''}
    to:  FILES_FOLDERS = {'files': 'files'}

    After the Nikola build, all the pdf files are placed into: /output/files/...

    Copy all pdf files into the files folder. E.g. test.pdf

    For a click-able link to the file that opens the download dialog box:
     
    <a href="/files/test.pdf" download>Download the pdf file: test.pdf</a>

Click to download a pdf file...

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <!-- Split over 3 lines -->
    <a href="/files/test.pdf" download>
    <button type="button">Click to download test.pdf file</button>
    </a>
    </p>
