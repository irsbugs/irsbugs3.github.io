<section id="by-jeremy-dawson"><h3>by Jeremy Dawson</h3>
<p>Reading Craig Murray's blog on political issues, I came across accounts
of his conviction for contempt. Reading the court judgment and
commentary on it, I was struck by certain things that seemed
particularly unfair (which have been pretty well commented on elsewhere
anyway). But writing about them anyway I came across further points to
comment on. So much so that it makes for a very long read.</p>
<p>Here are links to court judgments and the like:</p>

affidavits</a>
for his trial 27 Jan 2021</p></li>
</ul>
<p>to which I refer several times.</p>
<p>I set out to write this article because of my reaction to three
particular features of the contempt conviction judgment of 25 March
2021, things that seemed grossly unfair. In fact they are pretty well
covered in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2021/06/the-mind-of-lady-dorrian/">article by Kirsten
MacDonald</a>
but I found a lot else to write about as well.</p>
<p>In fact, although Kirsten MacDonald's article is entitled "The Mind of
Lady Dorrian" it is the judgment of three judges, Lady Dorrian, Lord
Menzies and Lord Turnbull. Of course it is drafted by one of the judges,
and since Kirsten MacDonald says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my last report I recounted that an experienced journalist told me
that they had never seen a judge so "emotionally invested", as
Dorrian against Craig Murray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that one may well be Lady Dorrian.</p>
<p>The court has more recently turned down Craig's appeal to the <em>nobile
officium</em>. On some points I refer to that judgment as well.</p>
</section><section id="browne-v-dunn"><h3>Browne v Dunn</h3>
<p>Craig swore <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2021/01/my-sworn-evidence-on-the-sturgeon-affair/">two
affidavits</a>
and said "my QC specifically made a point of saying I was happy to take
the stand for cross-examination by the Crown or questions by the
judges".</p>
<p>Quoting Kirsten MacDonald again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet Lady Dorrian decided to treat Murray's affidavit as lies despite
hearing no evidence to contradict it, and despite no claim from the
Crown that it was lies. She did so entirely on the basis that her own
reading of Murray's articles revealed to her a deliberate "campaign"
to reveal the names by "clues".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Sentencing Statement Lady Dorrian says "he was relishing the task
he set himself which was essentially to allow the identities of
complainers to be discerned" (also quoted in para 41 of the appeal
judgment) which is quite contrary to his affidavit on which he was not
cross-examined. The classic case on this is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brownevdunn.com/read-the-decision/">Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R
67</a> for which the
headnote says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in the course of a case it is intended to suggest that a witness
is not speaking the truth upon a particular point, his attention must
be directed to the fact by cross-examination showing that that
imputation is intended to be made, so that he may have an opportunity
of making any explanation which is open to him, unless it is
otherwise perfectly clear that he has hall full notice beforehand
that there is an intention to impeach the credibility of his story,
or (per Lord MORRIS) the story is of an incredible and romancing
character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is well-known: it has been described as a basic principle of
fairness. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/02/our-argument-in-court-today-full-text-of-our-submission/">Craig's submissions to the nobile
officium</a>
(para 25) refer to a Scottish case, <em>McKenzie v McKenzie</em> 1943 SC 108,
which says much the same thing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the most obvious principles of fairplay dictate
that, if it is intended later to contradict a witness upon a specific
and important issue to which that witness has deponed, or to prove
some critical fact to which that witness ought to have a chance of
tendering an explanation or denial, the point ought normally to be
put to the witness in cross-examination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing I've read indicates that the prosecuting counsel made a
challenge to Craig's credibility, so a decision of the High Court of
Australia may be relevant: it discusses the specific circumstance when
the scepticism of the plaintiff's evidence originates from the judge,
see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2011/11.html">Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA
11</a>
paragraphs 67 to 75:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>75. ... In the absence of any challenge from the cross-examiner to
the frankness and completeness of the plaintiff's evidence, it was
incumbent on the trial judge, if his conclusion that the plaintiff
had not been frank and complete was to play a role in his decision
adverse to the plaintiff, to make the challenge himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the appeal judgment says that Craig had notice that his
evidence was disputed. Unfortunately it doesn't give any details of what
was actually said, or whether it was specific enough to tell where and
how Craig's affidavit was challenged, so as to enable him to respond to
it. An Australian case which elaborates on the obligation is <em>Allied
Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation</em> (discussed in the
UK in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/267.html">Markem v
Zipher</a> at
paras 57ff). In it the judge says (quoted in para 15
<a class="reference external" href="http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/qld/ICQ/2016/19.html">here</a>)
"it should be made clear ... not only that the evidence of the witness
is to be challenged but also how it is to be challenged".</p>
<p>The appeal judgment cites <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/673.html">Balajigari v Home
Secretary</a> -
now there's a judgment that includes a level of detail that's useful for
a reader in a case turning on whether a party has adequate notice of the
case he has to meet.</p>
<p>The appeal judgment (para 64) also seems to suggest that giving evidence
by affidavit amounts to an election to not be cross-examined (even when
the contrary has been stated), and that therefore the rule in <em>Browne v
Dunn</em> does not apply. This seems bizarre - if only because it would be
such a strong disincentive to giving evidence by affidavit.</p>
</section><section id="ipso-code-of-practice-does-not-appear-to-have-engaged-him"><h3>IPSO Code of Practice does not appear to have engaged him</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[68] had he wished to identify the complainers he could have done so
prior to that date [the judgment says 10 March 2019, but it seems
this should read 10 March 2020], "knowing there was no general law or
court order in place preventing me simply from publishing". This
however "would not have been responsible journalism". [para 44 of
affidavit] That it would have been a clear contravention of the IPSO
Editor's Code of Practice and of the local convention are not matters
which appear to have engaged him</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should it? And if it did engage him, why should he mention it?
Should he also mention that, since his writings could be read in
England, that it would contravene the law in England (if that is so -
para 50)? Or any of the other good reasons (given in the judgment) for
not identifying complainers?</p>
<p>It's rather like if someone says "I don't nick other people's things,
because it's immoral", criticising him/her for not also saying it's
illegal. Or for not also saying it's contrary to the eighth commandment.
Or, for a better analogy, criticising someone of some other religion for
not also saying it's contrary to the eighth commandment.</p>
</section><section id="distinguishing-craig-from-mainstream-journalists"><h3>Distinguishing Craig from mainstream journalists</h3>
<p>This passage is quoted from the denial of permission to appeal to the UK
Supreme Court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[4] The applicant describes himself as a "journalist in new media".
Whatever that may involve, it is relevant to distinguish his position
from that of the mainstream press, which is regulated, and subject to
codes of practice and ethics in a way in which those writing as the
applicant does are not. To the extent that the submissions for the
applicant make comparisons with other press contempts, and the role
of mainstream journalists, this is a factor which should be
recognised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do the codes of practice and ethics matter? He is accused of
something which is equally criminal for any sort of journalist, or
anyone else. In fact if a journalist who is subject to these codes of
practice and ethics committed the same offence, and that offence also
breached those codes of practice and ethics, I could see an argument
that this would merit a greater penalty (though I wouldn't agree with
that argument). But, try as I might, I can't make any sense of the
reason given for treating a "journalist in new media" more harshly.</p>
<p>A similar comment is made in the <em>nobile officium</em> judgment, paras
77-78. Again, why should it matter whether one is a "journalist" or not?
Surely it is what he was doing - here, reporting a subject of arguably
immense public interest - that matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[75] ... There is force too in the argument that certain campaign
groups outside the mainstream media, such as non-governmental
organisations, should be afforded similar protection where they too
contribute to the public debate (...; <a class="reference external" href="https://lovdata.no/static/EMDN/emd-2011-018030.pdf">Magyar Helsinki: Bizottság v
Hungary (2020) 71 EHRR
2</a> at para
167)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is carefully phrased to exclude reference to Craig's activities. In
fact the whole of paragraphs 164 to 168 in that judgment need to be
read. It is certainly true that they refer in several places variously
to the press and to NGOs. This is naturally so: in a case involving the
press, a court will refer to the role of the press, in a case involving
an NGO, a court will refer to the role of NGOs.</p>
<p>But the dominant theme in paragraphs 164 to 168 is the role played,
which is described as a "public watchdog". (The word "watchdog" appears
10 times in those 5 paragraphs). There is no suggestion that the
"protection" is limited to particular players of that role, such as the
press or NGOs, and there are several indications to the contrary.
Indeed, in para 168 (quoted at para 12 of Craig's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/02/our-argument-in-court-today-full-text-of-our-submission/">appeal
submissions</a>)
it is made clear that it is not so limited: in particular it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the function of bloggers and popular users of the social media may be
also assimilated to that of "public watchdogs" in so far as the
protection afforded by Article 10 is concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the European court, it has been well recognised that
various sorts of "journalists" or others play this rule. The Committee
of Ministers of the Council of Europe has addressed this.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=09000016805e2fd2">Recommendation No. R (2000)
7)</a>
they define a "journalist" as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"any natural or legal person who is regularly or professionally
engaged in the collection and dissemination of information to the
public via any means of mass communication"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=09000016806415d9">Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 of the Committee of Ministers to member
States on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and
other media
actors</a>
they use the word "journalist" differently: as they repeatedly refer to
"journalists and other media actors", the effect is the same. They
elaborate on this in II. Principles, paragraphs 9 and 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9. ... Consequently, the European Court of Human Rights has
repeatedly recognised that individuals, civil society organisations,
whistle-blowers and academics, in addition to professional
journalists and media, can all make valuable contributions to public
debate, thereby playing a role similar or equivalent to that
traditionally played by the institutionalised media and professional
journalists.</p>
<p>10. The UN Human Rights Committee has similarly stated that
"journalism is a function shared by a wide range of actors, including
professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers
and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the
Internet or elsewhere". The UN General Assembly [<a class="reference external" href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/68/163">Resolution
68/163</a>, 18 December 2013] has
also acknowledged that "journalism is continuously evolving to
include inputs from media institutions, private individuals and a
range of organisations that seek, receive and impart information and
ideas of all kinds, online as well as offline ... thereby
contributing to shape public debate". According to the UN Plan of
Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, "the
protection of journalists should not be limited to those formally
recognised as journalists, but should cover others, including
community media workers and citizen journalists and others who may be
using new media as a means of reaching their audiences".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there is the <a class="reference external" href="https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=09000016805c5e9d">Declaration of the Committee of Ministers on the
protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media
actors</a>
of 30 April 2014 which refers to "others who contribute to inform the
public debate and persons performing journalistic activity or public
watchdog functions." (para 2) and to "Journalists and others who perform
public watchdog functions through the media" (para 4).</p>
<p>These last two documents were not accepted by the Russian Federation
insofar as they applied to "other media actors".</p>
<p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee in its <a class="reference external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/715606/files/CCPR_C_GC_34-EN.pdf">General Comment No.
34,
CCPR/C/GC/34</a>
(at para 44) says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Journalism is a function shared by a wide range of actors, including
professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers
and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the
Internet or elsewhere ..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in a document
called <a class="reference external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-47/fra_threats_and_pressures_paper_19751.pdf">Violence, threats and pressures against journalists and other
media actors in the
EU</a>
repeated some of the above and also said (pp 2-3)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the increased diversity of actors who contribute to public
debate, journalistic and media freedoms should not be exclusively
linked to the journalism profession. Instead, experts in the field
highlight that these freedoms are instrumental to the realisation of
the public watchdog role, a role that is also taken up by bloggers,
citizen journalists and whistle-blowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The High Court of Ireland, in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IEHC/2012/H376.html">Cornec v Morrice &amp;
Ors</a> said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>66. ... A person who blogs on an internet site can just as readily
constitute an "organ of public opinion" as those which were more
familiar in 1937 and which are mentioned (but only as examples) in
Article 40.6.1 [of the Irish Consititution] namely, the radio, the
press and the cinema.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="other-assertions-in-the-dorrian-judgment"><h3>Other assertions in the Dorrian judgment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[69] it [is] clear from paras 40-43 [of his first affidavit] that he
had formed the personal view that these identities were something
which "there is the strongest possible public interest in knowing"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite simply false. I say it is totally clear that Craig is
referring to the nature of the conspiracy rather than the names of
individual complainers. The fact that it may or may not be possible to
provide all the relevant information about the conspiracy without giving
clues as to the identity of complainers doesn't alter the fact that they
are two quite distinct topics. Obviously one can want to satisfy the
acute public interest in knowing about the "stitch-up" of Alex Salmond
without having any desire to indulge the public's interest (if any) in
the identities of the complainers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[71] ... the concept of contempt concerning him was that which
applies to prejudicing proceedings. The question of the identity of
the complainers ... clearly did not feature in his thinking. ... The
repeated reliance on the absence of a court order for anonymity ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sentences seem obviously contradictory. Paragraphs 40 and 44 of
his first affidavit make it clear that the question of the identity of
the complainers clearly did feature in his thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[71] ... The fact that he refers to defence witnesses giving evidence
"without the benefit of anonymity", and elsewhere refers to "the
screen of court enforced anonymity" in respect of complainers,
suggests a failure to understand the rationale and purpose behind
anonymity for complainers in sexual offence cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonsense. It means he understand its effect in this situation (and that,
as he alleges, it is used in this case for a purpose other than "the
rationale and purpose behind anonymity for complainers in sexual offence
cases"). Paragraph 42 of his first affidavit could hardly be clearer on
this point.</p>
</section><section id="comments-on-the-nobile-officium-judgment"><h3>Comments on the <em>nobile officium</em> judgment</h3>
<p>Similarly in the appeal court judgment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[62] ... He states that in writing the <em>Yes Minister Fan Fiction</em>
article it had been a challenge to work out how to tell the public of
the identities without being in contempt. It was not a challenge, it
was an impossibility, since doing so would be a breach of the plain
terms of the order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I can't say what was in the parts of the affidavit that have been
redacted, but it doesn't seem that they are relevant. So the court could
only be referring to para 54 of the first affidavit where Craig says "It
was, however, a challenge to work out how to tell them without being in
contempt of court ..." (referring to the <em>Yes Minister Fan Fiction</em>
article, see para 53). He says nothing to the effect that he is
referring to the identities.</p>
<p>Two comments on this. Firstly, with the context of what else Craig has
written, notably the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2019/08/the-alex-salmond-fit-up/">article of 23 August
2019</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2021/01/my-sworn-evidence-on-the-sturgeon-affair/">his
affidavits</a>
it seems quite clear to me that what he was interested in was an alleged
conspiracy to "stitch-up" Alex Salmond. The <em>Yes Minister Fan Fiction</em>
article also focusses on the <em>Moorov</em> doctrine and the fact that the
likely order for anonymity of complainers means that the usual
disincentive for such an operation is absent.</p>
<p>Secondly, at the time he was working out how to write that article,
supposing in fact that he wanted to tell the public the identities of
the complainers without being in contempt, then this is hardly a
"challenge", as he could just state their names. Because the court order
against identifying complainers only was made later. And he was aware of
this - see para 58 of the first affidavit.</p>
<p>I'm puzzling over why the judges think his interest was in disclosing
the identities, rather than exposing the "stitch-up". Maybe they just
don't consider such a conspiracy on the part of Police Scotland, the
COPFS and those close to the First Minister is newsworthy, or a matter
of public interest. In which case it is perhaps more understandable that
they don't understand someone else wanting to report on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[58] The mainstream media ... appear to have no difficulty in abiding
by what is a readily understandable and almost universally accepted
practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(and para 69 is similar) This is not so - unless Craig's statement is
false, where he says that his article of 11 March consisted entirely of
material from those media who had been allowed in court (first
affidavit, para 69). The Dorrian judgment specifically avoided looking
at what had previously been published (para 64).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[81] [Craig's] apparent total lack of remorse, and perhaps insight,
in relation to the consequences of his actions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remorse aspect is discussed in Craig's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/02/your-man-with-the-petition-my-appeal-against-imprisonment-for-journalism-23-february/">account of the appeal
hearing</a>:
the judgment makes no reference to this submission. As to his insight,
paras 77 and 117-119 of his first affidavit shows a considerable effort
to gain insight into the consequences of his actions.</p>
</section><section id="criticism-of-the-affidavits"><h3>Criticism of the affidavits</h3>
<p>In para 66 of the Dorrian judgment there is trenchant criticism of
Craig's affidavits, including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[66] The affidavits are full of material which is irrelevant,
hearsay, states gossip as fact ... The material is presented as proof
of his conclusions, inferences and his point of view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, evidence of his belief that there was a conspiracy to stitch up
Alex Salmond, and evidence as to grounds for that belief, is not
hearsay. And it is clearly relevant to his intent/motive/purpose in
publishing what he did. Inevitably, such material will contain his own
conclusions on the information he has received.</p>
<p>To the extent that it contradicts statements in the judgment about his
thinking, or his understanding, it is obviously neither hearsay nor
irrelevant.</p>
</section><section id="strict-liability"><h3>Strict liability</h3>
<p>The submissions of the prosecutor given in the Dorrian judgment at [17],
4.1, as to the nature of "intent" required was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"such a degree of carelessness or disregard of obligation leading to
interference with or material disruption in the course of the
administration of justice as to be equiparated with wilful or
deliberate disobedience or interference"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with a vague suggestion "4.2 It was submitted that the test might be
even lower" which seems to have been accepted in para 59 of the
judgment. So this matter is dealt with in Ground 1 (paras 15-21) of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/02/our-argument-in-court-today-full-text-of-our-submission/">submissions to the
appeal</a>.</p>
<p>The appeal court dealt with this issue in paras 60-61. It seems to be
saying that to constitute contempt, publication of certain material must
be deliberate, but that his belief, or his carelessness, as to whether
that material contravenes the order is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It further seems to be saying that this is not "strict liability". But
so many cases are about offences which involve deliberate actions but
where the issue is what needs to be shown about the defendant's
knowledge or belief of facts that make those actions illegal or not.
That is, an offence can be a "strict liability" offence in relation to
the defendant's knowledge, although not in relation to his actions.</p>
<p>The case cited in the argument, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2022/2.html">Pwr v
DPP</a>, at para 26,
makes this clear. And that case, at paras 26-28, is an example where
offences are described as "strict liability" (or not) depending on what
needs to be shown about the defendant's knowledge, where his actions
need to be deliberate. <a class="reference external" href="#fn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Where the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49">Contempt of Court Act
1981</a> does specify that
strict liability applies to some contempts (s1), it provides two further
sections of limitations (s2) and defences (s3). And, in comparison with
other cases in appeal courts, the consideration by this court of this
issue is very cursory. I think this case is a good example of why other
jurisdictions, such as Australia <a class="reference external" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/28.html">(Proudman v
Dayman)</a>,
Canada <a class="reference external" href="http://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt">(R. v. Sault Ste. Marie)</a> and Hong
Kong <a class="reference external" href="https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_frame.jsp?DIS=70334&amp;QS=%2B&amp;TP=JU">(Hin Lin Yee v
HKSAR)</a>
presume what they call "strict liability", as distinct from "absolute
liability", for some sorts of offences. This means that there are
defences available, roughly along the lines of those in s3 of the
Contempt of Court Act.</p>
</section><section id="moorov-similar-facts"><h3>Moorov, similar facts</h3>
<p>In the Salmond trial there were about a dozen charges, of a very wide
variety of conduct, although all (allegedly) of a sexual nature. This
happens in Scotland due to the <em>Moorov</em> doctrine, discussed in the
Scottish Law Commission project <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/law-reform/law-reform-projects/completed-projects/similar-fact-evidence-and-the-moorov-doctrine/">Similar fact evidence and the Moorov

Queen</a>
the question was whether evidence relating to a number of counts of
rape against different complainers was capable of being admitted in
relation to each count. In Scotland, the case would have appeared a
good candidate for the application of the <em>Moorov</em> doctrine; in
Australia it was held that evidence relating to the other charges had
to be excluded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of when charges may be tried together is closely related,
see para 4.64. The report discusses how similar the charges have to be
to qualify under <em>Moorov</em>, see pages 12-13, 78-81, 94-97. This <a class="reference external" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/vic/VSC/2021/253.html">recent

arose from the need to have separate trials for similar offences, and
the resulting suppression order re news of the first trial.</p>
</section><section id="meaning-of-not-guilty-not-proven-verdicts"><h3>Meaning of not guilty / not proven verdicts</h3>
<p>There is a stunning amount of nonsense that has been written about this,
along the lines that the jury decided the events described didn't
happen. Firstly, anywhere but Scotland, a Not Guilty verdict means only
that the jury were in some "reasonable" doubt. Is Scotland different? I
doubt it, see below.</p>
<p>Secondly, the jury may have agreed the events happened but didn't meet
the criteria of criminality given to them by the judge. This seems
particularly plausible for some of the accusations against Salmond.
Contrary to the nonsense I've seen on this (along the lines of "The jury
decides the facts, the judge decides the law"), the jury decides the
facts, the judge tells them the criteria for conduct to be criminal, and
the jury decides whether the facts meet those criteria. It <em>MUST</em> be
thus - if only because the judge doesn't know what facts the jury
accepts as proven. R v Wang (link below, paras 8 and 12) has more on
this.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the facts and the law, according to the jury's determination,
may dictate a conviction, and the jury can acquit anyway. There's
nothing to stop them, and no-one else will ever know. You may not
approve of this, but the House of Lords in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/9.html">R v
Wang</a> (para 16)
seemed quite sympathetic to the possibility of this happening. In this
case, if the jury has discerned the "stitch-up", this possibility may be
less unlikely than usual.</p>
<p>Does the possibility in Scotland of a Not Proven verdict affect this, ie
does it imply that a Not Guilty verdict indicates a positive finding in
favour of the accused? Well, firstly, according to this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/not-proven-verdict-related-reforms-consultation/pages/3/">Scottish
Government
publication</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no statutory, case law or generally accepted definition of
the not proven verdict ...</p>
<p>Jurors ... receive no instruction from a judge on the meaning of the
[not proven] verdict and how it differs from not guilty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one has no idea what any jury might think it means.</p>
<p>Secondly, the not proven verdict is used in such a small proportion of
acquittals (I've seen various figures, most commonly 17%) that it seems
unlikely that cases where the jury is not confident of the facts
generally result in a not proven verdict.</p>
<p>In short, the jury didn't decide that the complainers, or any of them,
were liars, or that none of the events described in their evidence
happened, etc.</p>
</section><section id="comments-in-defence-of-the-conspirators"><h3>Comments in defence of the conspirators</h3>
<p>A few other things comments that come to mind which I haven't seen in
the commentary I've read. (Though I don't see any of them as
compelling).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is a difference between a conspiracy to find evidence against
Salmond and a conspiracy to produce false evidence against him. There
seems to be a lot (like the massive police search for complaints)
which points to the one but not the other.</p></li>
<li><p>If you were going to invent complaints, wouldn't you invent
complaints which are rather less "daft" (to use the word in para 34
of Craig's first affidavit) than some of the complaints in this case?</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding person H, if you were going to invent an attempted rape
wouldn't you nominate a date when you were actually present? This
seems so obvious that I can't imagine a plausible explanation of the
reported evidence about that person's accusation.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="jigsaw-identification"><h3>Jigsaw identification</h3>
<p>Here are some problems I see with the concept of jigsaw identification,
as approached by the prosecution and the court.</p>
<p>For example, it is irrelevant that a piece of the jigsaw may have
already been published, para 64 of the Dorrian judgment. So therefore,
when the jigsaw pieces already in the public domain are sufficient to
identify a complainer, this implies that to republish any of them would
be in contempt. Thus, for example, publishing any relevant detail might
be forbidden. Even publishing the sex of the complainers might be a
crucial detail helping some readers to figure out some identities.</p>
<p>In fact there were some details which the prosecution alleged to be
identifying but the court found them to be not so. But since the appeal
court referred to "identification of a complainer within the community
in which she either lives or works" (para 67), who can tell what detail
might not help identification to someone with whom he/she lives or
works?</p>
<p>Craig's affidavit (para 55) talks about post-dated cheque information.
It's not made clear whether that would have contravened the order, had
it been in place at the time of the <em>Fan Fiction</em> article. The
prosecutor's submissions recounted in the Dorrian judgment (para [17],
3.2, 3.4), and paras 55-56 of the judgment, seem to focus on the piece
of the jigsaw which completes the picture. And in his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/02/your-man-with-the-petition-my-appeal-against-imprisonment-for-journalism-23-february/">description of
the
appeal</a>
Craig's QC asserts "the proper test should be whether, in combination
with material that was already fully in the public domain, somebody had
wilfully published the last piece of the jigsaw in order to enable
identification".</p>
<p>This raises interesting questions. Suppose, for example, that a
marmalade salesman subsequently is nominated as SNP candidate for a
"nice safe seat in the capital" (see the <em>Fan Fiction</em> article). This
could easily be the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle, enabling him to be
identified. So is he expected to keep secret the fact that he is
standing for election in that seat? If he did so, the seat might turn
out to be not so safe after all. Then, if he fails to be elected and
goes back to selling marmalade, that fact could help identify him. Is he
required to refrain from going back to selling marmalade, after not
winning the seat? Of course, a crucial piece of that jigsaw is knowing
which city is "the capital". Is it now illegal to mention that?
(Remember, it is irrelevant that a piece of the jigsaw may have already
been published, para 64 of the judgment).</p>
<p>Using the jigsaw analogy, is it illegal to tell others how to fit
together pieces of the jigsaw which they already possess? Is it illegal
to tell them which of their jigsaw pieces belong to this puzzle and
which ones belong to some other puzzle?</p>
<p>These questions are intended to show how difficult it is to come up with
any sensible criteria for when information offends against a prohibition
against jigsaw identification (at least if you accept that previous
publication of the same material is irrelevant), how uncertain the whole
subject is, and therefore how unreasonable it is to send someone to
prison on the basis of jigsaw identification.</p>
<p>Does this uncertainty make it unsuitable as a court order? Well, a court
order should be clear and unambiguous, para 31 of the Dorrian judgment
expresses this well enough. But with the court's approach, what matters
is what may be already known about a complainer by a small community of
people close to her, and then it is a matter of fine judgment as to what
risks identification of her within that "section of the public". Thus
one can be certain to not fall foul of the order only by not reporting
the proceedings at all. And a restriction which has this effect may well
go beyond what is permitted by Article 10 of the European Convention on
Human Rights.</p>
<p>This argument is referred to in para 7 of the court's denial of
permission to the UK Supreme Court. The court's view was that the test
"involves no imprecision". But even if the expression "real risk" is as
well understood as the expression "reasonable doubt", that doesn't mean
its application isn't nonetheless uncertain. In this case we need only
look at the variety of what people have found might identify
complainers. For example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Craig's first affidavit (paras 73-75) claims (linking to particulars)
that other media have published identifying information which he felt
should have been omitted</p></li>
<li><p>in para 77 of the affidavit he describes a survey to determine how
others have identified complainers (generally based on other
published material which has <em>not</em> been the subject of prosecutions)</p></li>
<li><p>the case for the prosecution of April 2020 alleged that several
details were identifying, whereas the court decided that they were
not</p></li>
<li><p>I personally first identified a complainer by reading the Dorrian
judgment, in particular, a detail the court found to be <em>not</em> likely
to identify a complainer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I have no knowledge (until now) about Scottish politics, just an
interest in legal scandals and an addiction to jigsaw puzzles.
Obviously, the Dorrian judgment didn't give any <em>new</em> information, but
it republished - and drew attention to - a piece of the jigsaw. Now, in
relation to tweets such as "I identified a victim from this blog", the
court (in its sentencing statement) said "A further factor of relevance
is that some members of the public posted responses to the respondent
indicating that they felt able to identify individual complainers from
his posts, but it appears that he took no action in response to these."
So it will be interesting to see what action is taken in response to
this information from me. [UPDATE: no surprises here! not even an
acknowledgement of my email]. And I'm happy to explain to them how the
judgment led me to identify a complainer.</p>
<p>And then the appeal judgment makes the identity of that complainer
absolutely clear - it's an easy two-piece jigsaw puzzle!</p>
<p>It seems extraordinary that the court can sentence someone to eight
months in prison for a level of carelessness which is (arguably) less
than the carelessness shown by the courts in preparing their judgments.</p>
<p>In something of an own goal by the COPFS, apparently they requested more
redactions from Craig's affidavits (beyond the numerous ones he had
already made). As can be seen by comparing the current version with the
earlier version available on web archive sites, most of these further
redactions were names of people, located in a context which gave no
indication (to me) that they were, or helped identify, complainers. But
the fact that the COPFS insisted on deletion of their names gave the
game away. So that is how I identified a second complainer.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Craig took his case to the European Court of Human Rights. His
post
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2022/11/strasbourg-cul-de-sac/">here</a>
gives his detailed submissions, and their (extremely cursory) dismissal
by that Court.</p>

<p><strong>[1]</strong> The term "strict liability" is used inconsistently. Where guilt

not.</p>
