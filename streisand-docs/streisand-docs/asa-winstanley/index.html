    <section id="asa-winstanley"><span id="top"></span><h2>Asa Winstanley</h2>
<p>What happened is best described in his own
<a class="reference external" href="https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/they-wont-stop-us-that-easily">words</a>.</p>
<p>The events were also described
<a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/uk-police-raid-home-seize-devices-eis-asa-winstanley">here</a>.</p>
<p>Asa was awakened at 5:40 am by a police raid, said to be "on account of
[his] social media posts", in connection with possible offences under
sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act (2006).</p>
<p>Asa has just published another article about it,
<a class="reference external" href="https://asawinstanley.substack.com/p/did-british-police-raid-me-for-this">here</a></p>
<p>Why the raid was scheduled for 5:40am was not apparent. Nor was why, to
find material he has posted on the internet, looking on the internet
isn't the way to go.</p>
<p>In any event, I encourage you to look at his writings that are so
disliked by the authorities: his substack, <a class="reference external" href="https://asawinstanley.substack.com/">Palestine is Still the
Issue</a>, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net/people/asa-winstanley">Electronic
Intifada</a> give
you plenty.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/10/18/vmbx-o18.html">World Socialist Web
Site</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winstanley is associate editor at <a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net">The Electronic
Intifada</a>, and has also written
for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.declassifieduk.org/">Declassified UK</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/">Middle
East Monitor</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/">Middle East
Eye</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thenational.scot/">The
National</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://jacobin.com/">Jacobin</a>, and is the author of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/weaponising-anti-semitism/">Weaponising
Anti-Semitism: How the Israel Lobby Brought Down Jeremy
Corbyn</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One must of course ask: does any of his writing amount to "encouragement
of terrorism"? Probably. Does that bother me? Not a bit. Why? Because of
the ludicrously broad definition of terrorism under the Terrorism Acts -
under which I myself am a "terrorist" (on account of my service with the
school cadets at my secondary school nearly 60 years ago). A <a class="reference external" href="terrorism.html">future
article</a> will elaborate on this.</p>
<p>Of course, if anyone comes across anything he has written which offends
against the Terrorism Acts <em>and</em> is actually objectionable, do let me
know. For example, had he supported cutting off water and power from
Gaza. (For this example of conduct offending against the Terrorism Acts
I am indebted to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/sir-keir-starmer-hamas-terrorism-israel-defend-itself/">Sir Keir
Starmer</a>.)</p>
<p>An internet search reveals that this event was hardly covered by the
mainstream media, the one exception I found being <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/24663361.counterterrorism-police-raid-home-pro-palestine-journalist-londo/">the National
(Scotland)</a>.
So here are my reading recommendations from among sources that did cover
it. (In some cases the articles on the web seem to be pay-walled but by
subscribing I got them sent by email).</p>

<p>They understand that whoever controls the narrative controls the
world.</p>
<p>So please don't make the mistake of thinking your attempts to
disrupt their narrative control aren't working. Don't let anyone
tell you your protests don't make a difference or your dissident
speech poses no threat to the powerful. If what we're doing wasn't
working, empire managers wouldn't be going nuts trying to stop us.</p>

<p>Panicked Zionist "elites" who run western states are lashing out in
fear at their opponents. As their popular support evaporates in the
face of clear evidence of appalling Israeli atrocities, they are
resorting to the methods of fascism.</p>

who says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>British counter-terrorism police visited the home of a man under
suspicion of practising journalism. Disgustingly, the man had been
raising awareness of Israel's genocide, and therefore had to be
dealt with.</p>
<p>... Asa Winstanley. He is one of the most prominent figures in the
worrying wave of radicals who believe genocide is wrong, even when
Israel does it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did I mention her work is described as "parody/satire"? Which is why I
always enjoy reading her articles. Though last time I looked up to see
what was the truth underlying <a class="reference external" href="https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/the-real-victim-of-genocide-is-the">one of her
articles</a>,
I found the facts were just as extraordinary as the "parody/satire".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.councilestatemedia.uk/p/the-british-government-is-still-arresting">Ricky / Council Estate
Media</a>,
who says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I don’t think any of the recent arrests/visits by
counter-terrorism police are going to result in convictions. I hope
I’m not tempting fate, but I think this is primarily about
intimidation, and that is despicable in itself.</p>
<p>The mistake Asa made is the same mistake I made: he built up a
platform and challenged powerful people. If you do that, those
powerful people will come for you. All of us with a sizable
platform are waiting to be next. It’s genuinely nuts.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, <a class="reference external" href="https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression">Aya / Challenge the
Narrative</a>,
a recommendation not because of writing about Asa Winstanley: but
because she discussed the Terrorism Acts, which was helpful for my
<a class="reference external" href="terrorism.html">own article</a>. She writes very powerfully and
passionately, eg,
<a class="reference external" href="https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-final-solution-in-gaza-is-happening">here</a>,
leaving me wondering if there is something wrong with me, that I don't
feel it nearly so intensely.</p></li>
