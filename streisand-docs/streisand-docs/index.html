<section id="what-is-the-streisand-effect"><h3>What is the Streisand Effect?</h3>
<p>Described <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Streisand effect</strong> is an unintended consequence of attempts to
hide, remove, or censor information, where the effort instead
increases public awareness of the information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name came about when the famous actress sued (unsuccessfully) to
have a photograph of her house removed from the internet. But it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>had been downloaded only six times prior to Streisand's lawsuit, two
of those being by Streisand's attorneys. Public awareness of the case
led to more than 420,000 people visiting the site over the following
month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of one recent incident (litigation to have a publicly
available <a class="reference external" href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/api/v1/file/46cc4e4c-553c-48b7-a6ab-11bd56d6a73b.pdf">report
(8MB)</a>
removed) the press has noted the Streisand effect, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.leefang.com/p/venture-capitalist-invokes-trans">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of Blackman's heavy-handed lawsuit, Poulson's reporting now
has coverage in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Daily Mail, and
Courthouse News – a classic example of the so-called 'Streisand
effect.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and
<a class="reference external" href="https://freedom.press/issues/anatomy-of-a-censorship-campaign-a-tech-execs-crusade-to-silence-a-journalist/">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blackman admitted in his declaration that since he sued Poulson, "the
sealed report and its contents ... have been spread and are spreading
far more broadly than before." It sounds like he’s already learning
about the Streisand Effect — let's make sure the next SLAPP-happy
tech bro knows about it too.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="what-is-this-site-about"><h3>What is this site about?</h3>
<p>Frequently there are attempts to punish or suppress people expressing
their views. And I've observed that even when such attempts are well
reported, there is often no link to what those people have said or
written.</p>
<p>These pages aim to provide those links, with the aim of increasing the
readership of that speech or writing. The goal of this is to make the
punishment or attempted suppression of it ineffective and
counterproductive. And hopefully to deter such punishment or
suppression.</p>
</section><section id="why-now"><h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>Well, I've had this idea for some time, was spurred on to action when
one day I got several emails with articles about the police action
against <a class="reference external" href="asa-winstanley">Asa Winstanley</a>. So he is the first
writer whose work I want to support and publicise.</p>
</section><section id="note-re-internet-archives"><h3>Note re internet archives</h3>
<p>Sometimes material which has been on the internet is removed. This can
be for various reasons, often that someone has decided that they don't
want you reading it. (In that case they may or may not have legal
authority to say you shouldn't read it.) There are places which keep a
record of material which has been on the internet in the past. The ones
I know of are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a> and</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://archive.today/">archive.today</a> (also accessible at
archive.li, archive.md, archive.ph, archive.is, archive.vn)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, for example, where someone complains that the list of MPs in the
group called Labour Friends of Israel (in the UK) is no longer
accessible, you can do a web search: (in archive.today), first for
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.lfi.org.uk/*">https://www.lfi.org.uk/*</a>, find the URL you want, which is
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.lfi.org.uk/lfi-parliamentary-supporters/">https://www.lfi.org.uk/lfi-parliamentary-supporters/</a>, then search for
that to see the page as it was saved at some past dates, of which the
most recent is <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.md/ykLus">https://archive.md/ykLus</a></p>
<p>Or when the complaint is made that Keir Starmer's "ten pledges" have now
been erased from his website: (in archive.today), first search for
<a class="reference external" href="https://keirstarmer.com/*">https://keirstarmer.com/*</a> and find the right URL, which is
<a class="reference external" href="https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/">https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/</a>, to get the archived version
at <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.vn/AayAz">https://archive.vn/AayAz</a></p>
</section><section id="plans-for-this-blog"><h3>Plans for this blog</h3>
<p>I'll probably put this stuff on substack or somewhere similar, if and
when I work out how to use it effectively. Meanwhile I do seem to have
succeeded in setting up something at
<a class="reference external" href="https://streisandeffect.substack.com/">https://streisandeffect.substack.com/</a>, and an email address
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:streisandeffect@substack.com">streisandeffect@substack.com</a> So far I've paid more attention to writing
than to working out how to put it somewhere like substack; but this page
has links to it all.</p>
<p>So what is intended to follow here is an expanding list of references to
particular cases, with their consequent reading recommendations. Please
send me suggestions of similar items to add!</p>
</section><section id="particular-cases-or-categories"><h3>Particular cases or categories</h3>
<section id="asa-winstanley"><h4>Asa Winstanley</h4>
<p>Read more <a class="reference external" href="asa-winstanley">here</a></p>
<p>. Writer about Palestine etc, investigated for terrorism, involving a
dawn police raid on his home, and confiscation of his electronic
devices. Read his writing on his substack <a class="reference external" href="https://asawinstanley.substack.com/">Palestine is Still the
Issue</a> or at the <a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net/people/asa-winstanley">Electronic
Intifada</a>.</p>
</section><section id="other-uk-police-actions"><h4>Other UK police actions</h4>
<p>These keep on happening, challenging my capacity to keep up with them.
See <a class="reference external" href="uk-police">separate article here</a>. I've also written an
<a class="reference external" href="terrorism.html">article about the legislation underlying a lot of the
actions</a>.</p>
</section><section id="other-government-actions"><h4>Other government actions</h4>
<p>Common examples are expulsion from a country (or eg cancelling visas),
arrests of journalists etc. See <a class="reference external" href="other-govt">this article
here</a>.</p>
</section><section id="social-media-censorship"><h4>Social media censorship</h4>
<p>Social media platforms can, on account of the political views expressed,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>restrict visibility of some articles/videos</p></li>
<li><p>when apparently open to all, in fact "de-platform" particular
contributors and delete their articles</p></li>
<li><p>and payment processors refuse to process payments for particular
content creators</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It may be argued that they have the same right to do this as a
mainstream newspaper or news broadcaster - but they certainly shouldn't
do this without the public knowing that's what is happening.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my purpose here is to encourage you to read/view material which
the social media platforms don't want you to see on account of the
political outlook expressed. See <a class="reference external" href="social-media">this article
here</a>.</p>
</section><section id="germany-the-palestine-congress"><h4>Germany - the Palestine Congress</h4>
<p>German police shut down the Palestine Congress in Berlin: they arrested
several attendees, banned a proposed speaker (the rector of the
University of Glasgow) from entering the country and (allegedly) banned
another speaker (formerly Greece's Minister of Finance) from speaking
there. See <a class="reference external" href="palestine-congress">this article here</a>.</p>
