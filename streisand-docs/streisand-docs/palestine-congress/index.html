<p>In April 2024 German police shut down the <a class="reference external" href="https://palaestinakongress.de/en">Palestine Congress in
Berlin</a>,</p>
<p>described by <a class="reference external" href="https://consortiumnews.com/2024/04/15/german-police-shut-down-palestine-conference/">Consortium
News</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://mondoweiss.net/2024/04/police-raid-berlin-conference-as-repression-of-palestine-activism-escalates-in-germany/">Mondoweiss</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.newarab.com/news/inside-germanys-orwellian-crackdown-palestine-congress">the New
Arab</a>.
Incidentally, another <a class="reference external" href="https://www.newarab.com/features/legal-battle-protect-germanys-pro-palestine-movement">article in the New
Arab</a>
seems to indicate how horribly authoritarian Germany has become
recently.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Consortium News article says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among those arrested by police at the Congress were Jewish activists.</p>
<p>Anti-Zionist Jewish activists are heavily targeted in Germany,
despite Germany’s attempt to justify its support to Israel as
“collective guilt” over the holocaust and repenting for its infamous
antisemitism.</p>
<p>Yet, according to researcher Emily Dische-Becker, almost a third of
those deplatformed, arrested, or otherwise sanctioned for alleged
antisemitism are themselves Jewish. Videos from the repression show a
Jewish activist being arrested outside of the conference, with police
seizing a banner that read “Jew Against Genocide.”</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="ghassan-abu-sitta"><h3>Ghassan Abu Sitta</h3>
<p>One of the intended speakers at the Congress was Ghassan Abu Sitta,
Palestinian-British surgeon and the rector of Glasgow University, who
was denied entry into Germany. The German authorities also threatened
him with legal action if he dared send his intended speech by video. See
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ghassan-abu-sittah-accuses-germany-complicity-genocide-refused-entry">this
article</a>,
which says he was "to give my evidence of the 43 days that I had seen in
the hospitals in Gaza, working in both al-Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals".
He says "This is exactly what accomplices to a crime do. They bury the
evidence and they silence or harass or intimidate the witnesses"</p>
<p>So here are some articles and videos about Dr Abu Sittah's experiences
in Gaza</p>

</ul>
<p>As a consequence (so it is said) of this ban, he was also prevented from
entering France and the Netherlands. (I find it difficult to believe
that Germany can ban someone from entering other countries - I would
think that these other countries have made their own decision to ban
him, but if I'm wrong on this, please let me know.) However a court in
Germany has overturned this ban - see
<a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/court-overturns-german-ban-surgeon-who-witnessed-gaza-war-crimes">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dr Abu Sittah was the subject of a complaint by a pro-Israel pressure
group, UK Lawyers for Israel, which the General Medical Council referred
to a Tribunal, which dismissed the complaint. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.newarab.com/opinion/ghassan-abu-sittah-racist-targeting-palestinian-doctors">article
here</a>.</p>
</section><section id="yanis-varoufakis"><h3>Yanis Varoufakis</h3>
<p>He was also <a class="reference external" href="https://diem25.org/diem25-and-mera25-engage-in-palestine-congress-for-solidarity-justice-and-peace/">prevented from speaking at the Palestine
Congress</a>,
and, apparently, <a class="reference external" href="https://diem25.org/chronicle-of-the-betatigungsverbot-against-yanis-varoufakis/">informed that he was banned from making
speeches</a>,
though apparently the authorities later denied this.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a class="reference external" href="https://diem25.org/yanis-varoufakis-palestine-congress-speech-that-was-banned-by-german-police/">here is the
speech</a>
he had intended to give at the Congress.</p>
</section><section id="palestine-conference-in-exile"><h3><a class="reference external" href="https://palaestinakongress.de/kongress-im-exil-speaker">Palestine Conference in Exile</a></h3>
<p>Apparently this event was held online on 25-26 July. One guesses that it
was organised from within Germany. Ali Abunimah (co-founder of The
Electronic Intifada, and mentioned elsewhere in these pages) says <a class="reference external" href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/germany-threatening-me-prison-talk-palestine">in
this EI
article</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authorities in Berlin are threatening me with prison for giving a
speech via Zoom to an audience in Germany on that country’s role in
Israel’s ongoing holocaust against the Palestinian people in Gaza.</p>
<p>I gave the talk anyway to thousands of people viewing it online, and
you can watch it in the video above. It was part of the Palestine
Conference in Exile held online on 25-26 July.</p>
<p>About two hours before my scheduled talk on 26 July, I received via a
lawyer in Germany a 15-page notice from government authorities in
Berlin informing me that I am prohibited from participating in the
conference by any means, including online. The penalties include
fines and up to one year in prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he indicates his video talk is available in the article linked above.
It is also available among the <a class="reference external" href="https://palaestinakongress.de/recordings">full proceedings of the
Congress</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, it occurs to me that the German authorities are either not
too bright, or really desperate, or both. Firstly, when one gives a
speech via Zoom, it is not to any particular audience, but to anyone
whom the host of the meeting allows in. Secondly, if he were bothered
about the prohibition, he could give a speech on his own Youtube channel
(or similar) (or the EI's Youtube channel, or the EI's own website),
which anyone, including those attending the conference, could watch.
Thirdly, [the page shown on Twitter of] the notice sent to him is
written in German - not much use in connection with a congress which was
conducted in English. And fourthly, hopefully, this would attract more
attention to his talk (which is my purpose in producing these webpages).</p>
