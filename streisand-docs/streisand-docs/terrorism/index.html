    <section id="introduction"><span id="top"></span><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before going into detail about the legislation, let me refer you to
Craig Murray's article <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2024/10/who-are-the-terrorists/">Who Are the
Terrorists?</a>
pointing out that the UK government regarded Nelson Mandela as a
terrorist, and the African National Congress as a terrorist
organisation, but, nonetheless, thousands of people wrote in support of
them. He goes on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under today’s legislation, every single one of those people writing
in support of the African National Congress or out campaigning for
the release of Nelson Mandela would have been liable for arrest under
Section 12(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same vein, Jonathan Cook has written, in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2024-08-30/starmer-jailing-palestine-supporters/">Starmer's purges of
Labour have mutated into the arrest of Palestine
supporters</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The need for careful distinctions should be obvious. Would praising
Hamas leaders, even its military leaders, for agreeing to sit down in
peace talks amount to “support” for a terror organisation? Should it
lead to arrest and jail time?</p>
<p>It was never a crime to “support” Sinn Fein – the political wing of
the IRA – in the sense of having complimentary things to say about
its long-time leader, Gerry Adams, or backing its political
positions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even illegal to “support” actual IRA “terrorists”. Back in
the early 1980s, many people criticised the Ulster authorities and
the British government of Margaret Thatcher for their barbaric
treatment of IRA prisoners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UPDATE (Jan 2025): In another more recent article Craig discusses <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/01/will-section-12-die-of-shame/">the
hypocrisy of the UK
government</a>
in relation to its support of HTS (the new Syrian government):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until the government, through an Order in Council, actually removes
the proscription of HTS as a terrorist organisation, it is still
illegal to support it in the UK – and it is illegal for government
ministers to support it, let alone ex-functionaries like John Sawers,
Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart.</p>
<p>Now in practice, there is nothing to prevent the massive hypocrisy of
the Terrorism Police harassing, and the CPS prosecuting, people for
very tangential “support” of Hamas and Hezbollah, while much more
blatant and open support of HTS goes unpunished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UPDATE (Feb 2025): In another more recent article Craig tells us <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/">United
Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and
Activists</a>:
as he says, "the second part [of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL-GBR-15-2024-Craig-Murray-et-al-UN-comm-to-UK-with-cover.pdf">letter from the
UN</a>]
is a devastating critique of the UK’s terrorism laws".</p>
<p>Now let me bore you with the detail.</p>
</section><section id="the-uk-terrorism-acts"><h2>The UK Terrorism Acts</h2>
<p>Firstly, note that there are two of them,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents">2000</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/contents">2006</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/1">Section 1 of the 2000
Act</a> gives
the definition of terrorism which is used in both Acts (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/20">s20(1) of
the 2006
Act)</a></p>
<p><strong>Terrorism: interpretation.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In this Act, "terrorism" means the use or threat of action where:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>the action falls within subsection (2);</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or
an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the
public or a section of the public; and</p>
<p>(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a
political, religious, racial or ideological cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Action falls within this subsection if it:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>involves serious violence against a person;</p></li>
<li><p>involves serious damage to property;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person
committing the action;</p>
<p>(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public
or a section of the public; or</p>
<p>(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to
disrupt an electronic system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(3) The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which
involves the use of firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or
not subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>In this section:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>"action" includes action outside the United Kingdom; and</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any
person, or to property, wherever situated,</p>
<p>(c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public
of a country other than the United Kingdom, and</p>
<p>(d) "the government" means the government of the United Kingdom,
of a Part of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the
United Kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of
terrorism includes a reference to action taken for the benefit of a
proscribed organisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's it. Nothing about who is doing it, whether the military of
the UK or another country or the military forces of a de-facto
government or anyone else. Nothing about whether things are being done
in a "just cause", however you might assess that.</p>
<p>In short, it covers equally what might be more usually described as
"war-fighting" than as "terrorism", and whether or not the war-fighting
is legal or "just" or involves war crimes or not.</p>
<p>Less surprisingly, nothing about whether the activities in question are
or were commanded by God (as, eg, in <a class="reference external" href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy
7:1-6</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13.htm#6">Deuteronomy
13:6-15</a>).</p>
</section><section id="offences"><h2>Offences</h2>
<p>So what are the offences related to terrorism?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/1">Section 1 of the 2006
Act</a>:
<strong>Encouragement of terrorism</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) This section applies to a statement that is likely to be
understood by a reasonable person as a direct or indirect
encouragement or other inducement to some or all of the members of
the public to whom it is published, to the commission, preparation or
instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>A person commits an offence if-</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) he publishes a statement to which this section applies or
causes another to publish such a statement; and</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>at the time he publishes it or causes it to be published, he-</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) intends members of the public to be directly or indirectly
encouraged or otherwise induced by the statement to commit,
prepare or instigate acts of terrorism or Convention offences;
or</p>
<p>(ii) is reckless as to whether members of the public will be
directly or indirectly encouraged or otherwise induced by the
statement to commit, prepare or instigate such acts or
offences.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(3) For the purposes of this section, the statements that are likely
to be understood by a reasonable person as indirectly encouraging the
commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences
include every statement which-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) glorifies the commission or preparation (whether in the past,
in the future or generally) of such acts or offences; and</p>
<p>(b) is a statement from which members of the public could
reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is
being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them in
existing circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(4) For the purposes of this section the questions how a statement is
likely to be understood and what members of the public could
reasonably be expected to infer from it must be determined having
regard both-</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>to the contents of the statement as a whole; and</p></li>
<li><p>to the circumstances and manner of its publication.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>It is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (1) to (3)-</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) whether anything mentioned in those subsections relates to the
commission, preparation or instigation of one or more particular
acts of terrorism or Convention offences, of acts of terrorism or
Convention offences of a particular description or of acts of
terrorism or Convention offences generally; and,</p>
<p>(b) whether any person is in fact encouraged or induced by the
statement to commit, prepare or instigate any such act or offence.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So these provisions apparently apply, for example, to the following
examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Arguing that particular violent action (meeting the defintion of
"terrorism") is justified</p></li>
<li><p>Arguing that it is not justified, and accordingly violent resistance
to it is justified</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="proscribed-organisations"><h2>Proscribed organisations</h2>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/3">Section
3</a> and
following, the Secretary of State may proscribe an organisation if he
believes that it is concerned in terrorism, which, as described above,
is a very low bar. There is apparently no obligation upon him to
proscribe such an organisation, so he can limit proscribed organisations
to ones he doesn't like.</p>
<p>But once an organisation is proscribed, then it is an offence to
"support" it.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/12">Section 12 of the 2000
Act</a>:
<strong>Support</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A person commits an offence if-</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>he invites support for a proscribed organisation, and</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(b) the support is not, or is not restricted to, the provision of
money or other property (within the meaning of section 15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1A) A person commits an offence if the person-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) expresses an opinion or belief that is supportive of a
proscribed organisation, and</p>
<p>(b) in doing so is reckless as to whether a person to whom the
expression is directed will be encouraged to support a proscribed
organisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2) A person commits an offence if he arranges, manages or assists in
arranging or managing a meeting which he knows is-</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>to support a proscribed organisation,</p></li>
<li><p>to further the activities of a proscribed organisation, or</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(c) to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong
to a proscribed organisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(3) A person commits an offence if he addresses a meeting and the
purpose of his address is to encourage support for a proscribed
organisation or to further its activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word "support" is, conveniently, not defined. Does it mean something
like "assist in the affairs of", or merely something like "express
approval of", or even just "approve of"?</p>
<p>In the case <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2016/61.html">Choudary &amp; Anor v R. [2016] EWCA Crim
61</a> the Court
said at para 35</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the section] does not prohibit the holding of opinions or beliefs
supportive of a proscribed organisation; or the expression of those
opinions or beliefs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that was before s12(1A) was inserted (apparently as a result of this
case). And "support", as in s12(1A)(b) now, is still not clearly
defined.</p>
<p>So, where a proscribed organisation is a government (or some sort of
pseudo-government), is it an offence to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>express approval of any government (or the like) operating schools,
hospitals and so forth?</p></li>
<li><p>express approval of a particular government (or the like) operating
schools, hospitals and so forth?</p></li>
<li><p>express an opinion as to the legality (or otherwise) of any action it
undertakes, or its adversaries undertake?</p></li>
<li><p>express an opinion as to whether in fact it meets the requirements to
be proscribed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Who knows? Which I guess is exactly the point. The authorities can
justify prosecuting anyone whose views they don't like. And of course,
even in the event of acquittal, for a defendant, undergoing the process
itself is substantial punishment.</p>
</section><section id="schedule-7"><h2>Schedule 7</h2>
<p>By <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7">Schedule 7 of the 2000
Act</a>,
sub-paragraph 2(1), a person arriving in the UK may be questioned</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person
falling within section
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40">40(1)(b)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is, a person who</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or
instigation of acts of terrorism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(as defined in Section 1).</p>
<p>Since it says "<em>being concerned in</em> the commission [etc] of acts of
terrorism" rather than, for example, <em>encouraging</em> or <em>inducing</em> the
commission [etc] of such acts (as in Section 1 of the 2006 Act), one
might think it means some actual involvement. If so it is hard to
imagine what grounds the authorities might have had for applying
Schedule 7 to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/chilling-arrest-of-french-publisher-by-uk-counter-terrorism-police-condemned-ernest-moret">Ernest
Moret</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2023/10/incredibly-i-face-investigation-for-terrorism-defence-funds-appeal/">Craig
Murray</a>.
But then, it is stated specifically, in sub-paragraph 2(4), that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph
whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person falls
within section 40(1)(b)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is, this encourages them to do this to anyone they choose.
In fact, according to David Miller, <a class="reference external" href="https://trackingpower.substack.com/p/what-is-islamophobia">people of Pakistani ethnicity are
over 150 times more likely to be detained under Schedule 7 than white
people</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand the questioning must be <em>for the purpose of
determining whether he appears to be a person who ...</em> I'd certainly
like to see the results of a case where the police were required to show
that that was in fact their purpose.</p>
</section><section id="training"><h2>Training</h2>
<p>Then of course there is training. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/6">Section 6 of the 2006
Act</a> covers
training "in connection with ... acts of terrorism" (though there need
not be <em>specific</em> acts in view), and we have discussed how broadly
"terrorism" is defined.</p>
<p>Somewhat overlapping this is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/54">Section 54 of the 2000
Act</a></p>
<p><strong>54 Weapons training.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) A person commits an offence if he provides instruction or
training in the making or use of-</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>firearms</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(2) A person commits an offence if he receives instruction or
training in the making or use of-</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>firearms</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to cover, fair and square, my own involvement in the school
cadets at my secondary school. In my defence, I was never a particularly
enthusiastic cadet - most of the kids in my class were promoted to
corporal for our second year, but not I. Though admittedly, this was
more because of my lack of interest in polishing boots and belt buckles,
rather than because of a distaste for racing around the bush firing
rifles (loaded with blanks) at pretend Vietnamese peasants.</p>
<p>There is a defence - if the person charged can prove that his
involvement was nothing to do with terrorism (as defined, broadly,
discussed above - difficult to prove, I imagine, when the training is
intended to introduce one to the possibility of a career which would
include firing rifles at Vietnamese peasants).</p>
<p>And both these sections about training offences apply to training
outside the UK (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/17">Section 17 of the 2006
Act</a>) and
the terrorism envisaged in the training may also be outside the UK
(s1(4) of the 2000 Act, quoted above). Thus the fact that my own
"terrorist training" took place in Australia is beside the point. This,
then, makes me a "terrorist" (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40">Section 40 of the 2000
Act</a>) and so
subject to arrest without a warrant (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/41">Section 41(1) of the 2000
Act</a>).</p>
</section><section id="further-lunatic-provisions"><h2>Further lunatic provisions</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/58">Section 58 of the 2000
Act</a> makes
it an offence to record, possess or view over the internet "information
of a kind likely to be useful to [a terrorist]" (s58(1)). Which
obviously includes road maps, train or bus timetables, and so forth.</p>
<p>In the case of this provision the House of Lords has said, in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/13.html">R v G, R
v J [2009] UKHL
13</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>42. Parliament cannot have intended to criminalise the possession of
information of a kind which is useful to people for all sorts of
everyday purposes and which many members of the public regularly
obtain or use, simply because that information could also be useful
to someone who was preparing an act of terrorism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's nice that in this case the court has decided that what the Act says
is too stupid to be taken seriously. But one can never rely on the
courts taking this approach.</p>
<p>There is a defence of "reasonable excuse" (s58(3)), of which examples
are given (s58(3A)). Bizarrely, one of the examples of reasonable excuse
is one of the possible scenarios where there is an absence of <em>mens
rea</em>, see paras 47, 50 and 60 of R v G, R v J. But a notable omission
from the examples of reasonable excuse is the very likely candidate,
having a reason for the possession (etc) that is nothing to do with
terrorism. In fact the House of Lords, in R v G, R v J, overruling an
earlier case, decided that this would not necessarily be a reasonable
excuse (paras 71 to 73 and following).</p>

<p>There seems to be quite a smorgasbord of legislation which the
authorities can use against people they don't like. In the case of <a class="reference external" href="https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/">Kit
Klarenberg</a>
it was the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/contents">Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act
2019</a> Mostly,
it seems, this Act amends the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006, but its
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3">Schedule 3</a>
seems to provide new powers. Schedule 3 seems to be mostly very similar
to Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 but for a different purpose.</p>
<p>By <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3">Schedule
3</a>,
sub-paragraph 1(1), a person arriving in the UK may be questioned</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... for the purpose of determining whether the person appears to be a
person who is, or has been, engaged in hostile activity ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of "hostile activity" seems arguably sensible, but as
with Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, we have in, sub-paragraph
1(4)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph
whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person is or has
been engaged in hostile activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, again, the questioning must be for this purpose.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression">Aya / Challenge the
Narrative</a>
for mentioning this case. The case <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/64.html">R v Gul [2013] UKSC
64</a>, in the
Supreme Court, was primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in section
1 of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>
<p>It says a lot about the breadth of the definition of terrorism, notably
in paragraphs 28,29,33,34,61. In particular: (the following expressed
rather tentatively in para 28)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the definition of terrorism in section 1 in the 2000 Act is, at
least if read in its natural sense, very far reaching indeed. Thus,
on occasions, activities which might command a measure of public
understanding, if not support, may fall within it: for example,
activities by the victims of oppression abroad, which might command a
measure of public understanding, and even support in this country,
may well fall within it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following are about or quoted from an Independent Reviewer of the
legislation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>actions may amount to terrorism within the definition "even when they
might otherwise constitute lawful hostilities under international
humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive
governments)" (para 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the definition was referred to as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"remarkably broad – absurdly so in some cases" (para 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<p>"the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist
group to be turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation
in a lawful armed conflict, however great the provocation and however
odious the regime which they have attacked" (para 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment makes the point that the consent of the DPP is required for
a prosecution, this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should
not be instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public
interest" (para 36). However, importantly, the Court pointed out</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Crown's reliance on prosecutorial discretion is intrinsically
unattractive, as it amounts to saying that the legislature, whose
primary duty is to make the law, and to do so in public, has in
effect delegated to an appointee of the executive, albeit a respected
and independent lawyer, the decision whether an activity should be
treated as criminal for the purposes of prosecution. ... [This] risks
undermining the rule of law. It involves Parliament abdicating a
significant part of its legislative function to an unelected DPP, or
to the Attorney General, who, though he is accountable to Parliament,
does not make open, democratically accountable decisions in the same
way as Parliament. Further, such a device leaves citizens unclear as
to whether or not their actions or projected actions are liable to be
treated by the prosecution authorities as effectively innocent or
criminal ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore the protection afforded by the DPP's "prosecutorial
discretion" applies only to the bringing of charges to court. Regarding
"police officers deciding whom to arrest or to stop at a port" (para
34), or the Home Secretary deciding which organisations to proscribe, it
provides no such protection. The judgment discusses this in paras
33,34,37,63,64. Thus the Independent Reviewer referred to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the risk that "strong powers could be used for purposes other than
the suppression of terrorism as it is generally understood" (para 33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that even where the activity does not warrant prosecution</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the lawfulness of executive acts such as detention, search,
interrogation and arrest could be questioned only very rarely indeed
in relation to any actual or suspected involvement in actual or
projected acts involving "terrorism", in circumstances where there
would be no conceivable prospect of such involvement being
prosecuted. Secondly, the fact that an actual or projected activity
technically involves "terrorism" means that, as a matter of law, that
activity will be criminal under the provisions of the 2000 and 2006
Acts, long before, and indeed quite irrespective of whether, any
question of prosecution arises. (para 37)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judgment in the appeal (para 5) recounts how, in the trial the jury
asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Re: definition of terrorism in [section 1 of the 2000 Act], would
the use of force by Coalition forces be classed as terrorism?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to that question, the judge gave the following direction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... the use of force by Coalition forces is not terrorism. They do
enjoy combat immunity, they are ordered there by our government and
the American government, unless they commit crimes such as torture or
war crimes ...".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to say that I am not at all surprised that there should be some
such legal principle giving such forces "combat immunity". But I would
be very surprised indeed if there were legislation somewhere (of which
I've not seen any hint) which amends the definition of "terrorism" in
the 2000 Act to exclude action by "Coalition forces". In fact, the
Independent Reviewer mentioned the "potential application of the
Terrorism Acts even to UK forces engaged in conflicts overseas" (para
61).</p>
<section id="r-v-f-2007-ewca-crim-243"><h3>R v F [2007] EWCA Crim 243</h3>
<p>The case <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/243.html">R v F [2007] EWCA Crim
243</a>, in the
Court of Appeal, also primarily about the meaning of "terrorism" in
section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000, makes some similar points at paras
11,27,32.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11. ... "counter-terrorism measures were capable of application to
speech or actions concerning resistance to an oppressive regime
overseas ..."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<p>27. ... Finally, the legislation does not ... exculpate what some
would describe as terrorism in a just cause.</p>
<p>32. ... the terrorist legislation applies to countries which are
governed by tyrants and dictators. There is no exemption from
criminal liability for terrorist activities which are motivated or
said to be morally justified by the alleged nobility of the terrorist
cause.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="another-problem-with-prosecutorial-discretion"><h3>Another problem with prosecutorial discretion</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the consent of the DPP is required for a
prosecution, this being seen as "ensuring that a prosecution should not
be instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public interest",
and I've noted above what the Court said about that in R v Gul.</p>
<p>There is an additional problem with this line of thinking. It accepts
that there are some circumstances where there should not be a
prosecution, even when a literal application of the Acts to the facts of
a case makes a defendant guilty. But the jury, not the DPP, decides what
facts have been proved against a defendant, and no one other than the
jury will ever know what facts have been proved. So, if the surrounding
circumstances, for example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>that the terrorism constitutes lawful hostilities under international
humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive
governments)</p></li>
<li><p>that the terrorism is participation in a lawful armed conflict, after
great provocation and against an odious regime</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(these examples taken from R v Gul, see above) justify saying the
prosecution should not proceed, then (unless all the facts are agreed)
only the jury can decide this.</p>
<p>But there have been instances recently of judges refusing to allow
defendants to give evidence or argue about aspects of a case which don't
strictly affect guilt or not under the legislation as written - so then
the jury wouldn't be in a position to take these other aspects into
account.</p>
<p>I will discuss this more in a page on Trudi Warner.</p>
