    <section id="other-uk-police-etc-actions"><span id="top"></span><h2>Other UK Police (etc) actions</h2>
<p>So many of these! When you read about them you might think that Britain
must be a wonderfully crime-free society, that the police have time to
spend on trivia like these cases. But no. Persecuting opinions they
don't like is clearly more important than, for example, bike theft.
Regarding which, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/how-to-catch-a-london-bike-thief">this
article</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dunn said he had sympathy with the Met Police's response given their
financial constraints: "You would honestly struggle to put bike theft
quite high up the list when you look at what else happens in society
- rapes, murders, assaults. It obviously and probably should be put
lower down that pecking order."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently this should now read "when you look at what else happens in
society - rapes, murders, assaults, <a class="reference external" href="https://ayauk.substack.com/p/the-coconut-trial-the-insane-suppression">placards depicting politicians as
coconuts</a>,
commentary on Palestine by those opposed to genocide, ..."</p>
<p>A lot of these actions are based on one of the Terrorism Acts, or
similar legislation. I've also written an <a class="reference external" href="terrorism.html">article about this
legislation</a>, in particular about the absurd
breadth of the definition of "terrorism".</p>
<p>UPDATE (Feb 2025): Some news in an article by Craig Murray: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/">United
Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and
Activists</a>:
the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL-GBR-15-2024-Craig-Murray-et-al-UN-comm-to-UK-with-cover.pdf">letter from the
UN</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We note that the examination of each journalist [... was] conducted
despite the apparent absence of a credible “terrorist” connection. We
are concerned that such powers carry a risk of intimidating,
deterring, and disrupting the ability of journalists to report on
topics of public importance without self-censorship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David Miller has written an article about several of these cases, in <a class="reference external" href="https://english.almayadeen.net/articles/opinion/the-uk-attempt-to-criminalise-dissent-on-palestine">Al
Mayadeen</a>
and in <a class="reference external" href="https://trackingpower.substack.com/p/the-uk-attempt-to-criminalise-dissent">his own
substack</a>.
He says most of those he mentions have been guests on <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/PDeclassified">Palestine
Declassified</a>. So there's a Streisand
Effect viewing (it has videos) recommendation. There seem to be other
links to it, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Section/150108">here</a>,

<section id="haim-bresheeth"><h3>Haim Bresheeth</h3>
<p>Quoting <a class="reference external" href="https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/israel-secures-victory-over-the-biggest">Laura / Normal Island
News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will be pleased to know British police are taking their role as
enforcers of the Israeli state so seriously that they’ve arrested a
Jewish Israeli academic because he explained Israel is fighting an
unwinnable war. Professor Haim Bresheeth pointed out that British
police have been arresting people for opposing genocide, leaving
police with no choice but to arrest him under the Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>Metropolitan police explained they actually arrested Prof Bresheeth
for “expressing support for a proscribed terrorist organisation”.
Awkwardly, a recording of his speech shows he said no such thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further discussion by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.councilestatemedia.uk/p/britain-is-counting-jewish-israeli">Ricky / Council Estate
Media</a>:
it is all worth quoting, but in particular</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either an overzealous police officer overreacted, or more likely,
this was part of a strategy of silencing opposition to genocide.</p>
<p>The officer might as well have said: "I’m arresting you for being the
wrong kind of Jew and having a conscience. We’ll work out the details
later."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-prof-haim-bresheeths-anti-genocide-speech-before-he-was-arrested-for-terrorism/">Skwawkbox
article</a>
contains a video of his speech, and says, accurately,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, as a hearing of his speech immediately reveals, rather than
supporting any [proscribed organisation] Bresheeth made the factual
observation that Israel has proven unable to defeat Hamas, Hezbollah
and the Houthis ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Skwawkbox also <a class="reference external" href="https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-video-see-jewish-professors-arrest-by-met-police-for-terrorism-of-condemning-israels-genocide/">links to a video of the
arrest</a>
in which it is alleged that Prof Bresheeth made a "hate speech", and
that this justifies arrest under the <a class="reference external" href="terrorism.html">Terrorism Act
2000</a>.</p>
<p>As I've come to expect, this event was hardly covered in the UK
mainstream media. Who did think it was worth covering?</p>

</ul>
<p>Finally, my recommendations for reading/viewing what they don't want you
to see. Of course there is the video of the speech itself, in the
Skwawkbox page linked above. Then, Prof Bresheeth has a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.haimbresheeth.com/">website</a>, which seems to be more
about events 10 and 15 years ago.</p>
<p>It's interesting, though, as a glance at <a class="reference external" href="https://haimbresheeth.com/gaza/gaza-carnage-archive/">this part of the
site</a> leaves me
with the impression that nothing much has changed since then, except
that both sides have cooperated in ensuring that it is less easy to
ignore the conflict.</p>

<p>He was detained and questioned, for over 5 hours, under <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3">Schedule
3</a> of the
Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, "for the purpose
[allegedly] of determining whether [he] appears to be a person who is,
or has been, engaged in hostile activity". Schedule 3 seems to be mostly
very similar to Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 but to do with
"hostile activity" rather than "terrorism".</p>
<p>This encounter is described in <a class="reference external" href="https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/">The

<p>Of the many publications I wrote for, Kit says, "their overwhelming, if
not exclusive, interest was in The Grayzone." This makes the Streisand

Delinquents</a></p>
</section><section id="tommy-robinson"><h3>Tommy Robinson</h3>
<p>This website is about encouraging you to read, and providing links to,
writing which have been censored, or the writers punished, etc. So by
rights I should be providing a link to Tommy Robinson's film,
"Silenced", and suggesting you view it. But I'm not doing so. Not
primarily because he is so "right-wing" that he is not welcome in even
Nigel Farage's Reform party.</p>
<p>The story, briefly, is that Robinson, whose real name is Yaxley-Lennon,
had made some very nasty statements about a schoolboy, who sued him for
defamation. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/2008.html">Hijazi v Yaxley-Lennon [2021] EWHC 2008
(QB)</a>. The
judge found (para 163)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the Defendant has failed to demonstrate the truth of his
allegations. The Defendant took on the burden of proving his
allegations to be true. He has failed. In reality, and for the
reasons I have explained, his evidence fell woefully short.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judge also issued an injunction against Yaxley-Lennon prohibiting
him from repeating the allegations. In October 2024 he was found to have
breached the injunction, for which he was committed to prison for 18
months (which would get reduced by half). See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2024/2732.html">HM Solicitor General v
Yaxley-Lennon [2024] EWHC 2732
(KB)</a>: para 6
(terms of the injunction), paras 10 and 16 (detail of breaches). It
appears in particular that in the film "Silenced" Yaxley-Lennon
complains about being silenced (by the injunction) and also repeats the
defamatory allegations.</p>
<p>So, rather than recommend you watch the film, I recommend you read the
first judgment linked above. Or the writeup by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.logicallyfacts.com/en/article/tommy-robinson-silenced">Logically Facts,
here</a>.
As a matter of fact, it may be that to recommend you watch the film (as,
reportedly, Elon Musk has done) would itself be a contempt of court, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/UKHL_2002_50.html">Attorney General v Punch Ltd [2002] UKHL
50</a> -
comments from legal experts welcome!</p>
<p>Another comment: the police seem to have got me to agree with Tommy
Robinson about something (quite an achievement), namely misuse of
terrorism legislation. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv0TW2LF_dE">an interview he did with Jordan
Peterson</a>, from 11:33.
Apparently he was detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
According to him, the police gave him a notice saying they believed [he
was involved in - sound unclear] the instigation and preparation of acts
of terrorism, but then they told him they didn't actually believe that.
That's odd, since the legislation doesn't require the police to believe
it, but it <em>does</em> require them to be questioning him <em>for the purpose</em>
of determining whether it is so. What I've read about him is mostly
adverse, but nothing suggestive of a connection with terrorism.</p>

<p>She was arrested under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (support for

<p>As reported by Skwawkbox (link below),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Starmer government, which has refused to condemn Israel’s actions
and has said it considers the use of the word ‘genocide’ unhelpful,
is engaged in an escalating campaign of abusing anti-terror
legislation to raid and arrest journalists and activists – many of
them, like Ms Kahn and Prof Bresheet, Jewish – who expose Israel’s
war crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes in these situations it is hard to find what the person
victimised actually wrote or said, which is frustrating because it is
the purpose of this website to publicise just that. But in this case
